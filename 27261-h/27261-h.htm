<h3>DEDICATION</h3>


<p class="start pgbrk"><i><img class="initial" src="images/t.png"
 width="143" height="200" alt="T" /><span class="start">his</span> dark and wayward book
is affectionately dedicated to
my enemies&mdash;to the curious
ones who take fanatic pride
in disliking me; to the baffling
ones who remain enthusiastically
ignorant of my
existence; to the moral ones
upon whom Beauty exercises
a lascivious and corrupting
influence; to the
moral ones who have relentlessly chased God
out of their bedrooms; to the moral ones who
cringe before Nature, who flatten themselves
upon prayer rugs, who shut their eyes, stuff
their ears, bind, gag and truss themselves and
offer their mutilations to the idiot God they
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twelve</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have invented (the Devil take them, I grow
bored with laughing at them); to the anointed
ones who identify their paranoic symptoms as
virtues, who build altars upon complexes; to
the anointed ones who have slain themselves and
who stagger proudly into graves (God deliver
Himself from their caress!); to the religious
ones who wage bloody and tireless wars upon
all who do not share their fear of life (Ah,
what is God but a despairing refutation of
Man?); to the solemn and successful ones who
gesture with courteous disdain from the depth
of their ornamental coffins (we are all cadavers
but let us refrain from congratulating each
other too courteously on the fact); to the prim
ones who find their secret obscenities mirrored
in every careless phrase, who read self
accusation into the word sex; to the prim ones
who wince adroitly in the hope of being mistaken
for imbeciles; to the prim ones who
<a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fornicate apologetically (the Devil can-cans in
their souls); to the cowardly ones who borrow
their courage from Ideals which they forthwith
defend with their useless lives; to the
cowardly ones who adorn themselves with castrations
(let this not be misunderstood); to the
reformers&mdash;the psychopathic ones who publicly
and shamelessly belabor their own unfortunate
impulses; to the reformers (once again)&mdash;the
psychopathic ones trying forever to drown their
own obscene desires in ear-splitting prayers for
their fellowman&#8217;s welfare; to the reformers&mdash;the
Freudian dervishes who masturbate with
Purity Leagues, who achieve involved orgasms
denouncing the depravities of others; to the reformers
(patience, patience) the psychopathic
ones who seek to vindicate their own sexual
impotencies by padlocking the national vagina,
who find relief for constipation in forbidding
their neighbors the water closet (God forgives
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fourteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>them, but not I); to the ostracizing ones who
hurl excommunications upon all that is not
part of their stupidity; to the ostracizing ones
who fraternize only with the worms inside
their coffins (their anger is the caress incomparable);
to the pious ones who, lacking the
strength to please themselves, boast interminably
to God of their weakness in denying themselves;
to the idealistic ones who, unable to confound
their neighbors with their own superiority, join
causes in the hope of confounding each other
with the superiority of their betters (involved,
but I am not done with them); to the idealistic
ones whose cowardice converts the suffering of
others into a mirror wherein stares wretchedly
back at them a possible image of themselves; to
the idealistic ones who, frightened by this possible
image of themselves, join Movements for
the triumph of Love and Justice and the overthrow
of Tyranny in the frantic hope of breaking
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the mirror; to the social ones who regard
belching as the sin against the Holy Ghost,
who enamel themselves with banalities, who
repudiate contemptuously the existence of their
bowels (Ah, these theologians of etiquette, these
unctuous circumlocutors, a pock upon them); to
the pure ones who masquerade excitedly as
eunuchs and as wives of eunuchs (they have
their excuses, of course, and who knows but the
masquerade is somewhat unnecessary); to the
pedantic ones who barricade themselves heroically
behind their own belchings; to the smug
ones who walk with their noses ecstatically buried
in their own rectums (I have nothing against
them, I swear); to the righteous ones who masturbate
blissfully under the blankets of their
perfections; to the righteous ones who finger
each other in the choir loft (God forgive me if
I ever succumb to one of them); to the critical
ones who whoremonger on Parnassus; to the
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>critical ones who befoul themselves in the Temples
and point embitteredly at the Gods as the
sources of their own odors (I will someday
devote an entire dedication to critics); to the
proud ones who urinate against the wind (they
have never wetted me and I have nothing against
them); to the cheerful ones who tirade viciously
against all who do not wear their protective
smirk; to the cheerful ones who spend their
evenings bewailing my existence (the Devil pity
them, not I); to the noble ones who advertise
their secrets, who crucify themselves on bill-boards
in the quest for the Nietzschean solitude;
to the noble ones who pride themselves on their
stolen finery; to the flagellating ones who go
to the opera in hair shirts, who excite themselves
with denials and who fornicate only on
Fast Days; to the just ones who find compensation
for their nose rings and sackcloth by
hamstringing all who refuse to put them on&mdash;all
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventeen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>who have committed the alluring sins
from which their own cowardice fled; to the
conservative ones who gnaw elatedly upon old
bones and wither with malnutrition; to the
conservative ones who snarl, yelp, whimper
and grunt, who are the parasites of death;
who choke themselves with their beards; to the
timorous ones who vomit invective upon all
that confuses them, who vituperate, against all
their non-existent intelligence cannot grasp;
to the martyr ones who disembowel themselves
on the battlefield, who crucify themselves upon
their stupidities; to the serious ones who mistake
the sleep of their senses and the snores of
their intellect for enviable perfections; to the
serious ones who suffocate gently in the boredom
they create (God alone has time to laugh
at them); to the virgin ones who tenaciously
advertise their predicament; to the virgin ones
who mourn themselves, who kneel before keyholes;
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to the holy ones who recommend themselves
tirelessly and triumphantly to God (I
have never envied God His friends, nor He,
mine perhaps); to the never clean ones who
bathe publicly in the hysterias of the mob; to
the never clean ones who pander for stupidity;
to the intellectual ones who play solitaire with
platitudes, who drag their classrooms around
with them; to these and to many other abominations
whom I apologize to for omitting, this
inhospitable book, celebrating the dark mirth
of Fantazius Mallare, is dedicated in the hope
that their righteous eyes may never kindle with
secret lusts nor their pious lips water erotically
from its reading&mdash;in short in the hope that
they may never encounter the ornamental
phrases I have written and the ritualistic lines
Wallace Smith has drawn in the pages that

 /></span>FANTAZIUS MALLARE</h2>

<h2>[I]</h2>


<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/f.png"
 width="143" height="200" alt="F" /><span class="start">antazius Mallare</span>
considered himself mad
because he was unable to
behold in the meaningless
gesturings of time, space and
evolution a dramatic little
pantomime adroitly centered
about the routine of
his existence. He was a
silent looking man with black hair and an
aquiline nose. His eyes were lifeless because
they paid no homage to the world outside him.</p>

<p>When he was thirty-five years old he lived
alone high above a busy part of the town. He
was a recluse. His black hair that fell in a
slant across his forehead and the rigidity of his
eyes gave him the appearance of a somnambulist.
<a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>He found life unnecessary and submitted
to it without curiosity.</p>

<p>His ideas were profoundly simple. The
excitement of his neighborhood, his city, his
country and his world left him unmoved. He
found no diversion in interpreting them. A
friend had once asked him what he thought
of democracy. This was during a great war
being waged in its behalf. Mallare replied:
&ldquo;Democracy is the honeymoon of stupidity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There lived with him as a servant a little
monster whom he called Goliath and who was
a dwarfed and paralytic negro. Goliath&#8217;s age
was unknown. His deformities gave him the
air of an old man and his hunched back made
him seem too massive for a boy. But in studying
him Mallare had concluded that he was
a boy.</p>

<p>Goliath had been one of the first symptoms
of Mallare&#8217;s madness. He had brought the little
monster home from an amusement park one
summer night. Goliath had been standing
doubled up, his pipe stem arms hanging like a
<a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>baboon&#8217;s, his enlarged black head lifted and
his furious eyes staring at a Wheel of Fortune.</p>

<p>When they left the confetti-electrics of
the park behind, Mallare spoke to the dwarf
whose wrinkled hand he was holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come home with me I will make
you a servant and give you a fine red suit to
wear. Also, I will call you Goliath for no
reason at all, since I am at war with reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goliath said nothing but sat staring happily
out of the window of an automobile as
they rode home.</p>

<p>The home of Fantazius Mallare was filled
with evidences of his past. There were clay
and bronze figures and canvases covered with
paintings. These had been the work of his
hands. It was to be seen that he had once given
himself with violence to the creation of images.
And for this reason he was still known among
a few people as an artist.</p>

<p>In the days when he had worked to create
images Mallare had been alive with derisions.
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>He desired to give them outline. But the
desire went from him. The brilliant fancies
of his thought began slowly to bore him. The
astounding images that still bowed themselves
into his mind became like a procession of mendicants
seeking alms of him. He folded his
hands and with an interested smile watched
his genius die.</p>

<p>At the time of this curious tragedy Mallare
was thirty. He kept a Journal in which he
wrote infrequently. There was in this Journal
little of interest. Apparently he had amused
himself during his youth jotting down items of
preposterous unimportance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw a man with a red face,&rdquo; he would
write one week. The next he would add a
line, &ldquo;There are seven hundred and eighty-five
normal strides between the lamp-post and my
front door.&rdquo; Turning a page a month later he
would meticulously set down the date, the hour
of the day, the direction of the wind and under
it write out, &ldquo;I have a stomach ache from eating
peaches.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-five</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Journal bristled with innocuous
informations. An acquaintance of the period,
interested in Mallare&#8217;s work as an artist, smiled
and commented, &ldquo;These are, no doubt, symbols.
A psychological code into which you have
translated great inner moments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare answered, &ldquo;On the contrary.
They are the only thoughts I have had in which
I could detect no reason. It has amused me to
put down with great care the few banalities
which have normalized my days. They are
very precious to me, although they have no
value in themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the ability to think such absurdities
as you have read that has kept me from suicide.
The will to live is no more than the hypnotism
of banalities. We keep alive only by maintaining,
despite our intelligence, an enthusiasm for
things which are of no consequence or interest
to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I saw a man with a red face aroused
in me a gentle curiosity lacking in words or
emotion. The desire to live is compounded of
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>an infinity of such gentle curiosities which
remain entirely outside of reason. This never-satisfied
and almost non-existent curiosity we
have toward things, masquerades under the
intimidating guise of the law of self-preservation.
Man is at the mercy of life since, his intelligence
perceiving its monotony and absurdity,
he still clings to it, fascinated by the accumulated
rhythm of faces, impressions, and events
which he despises.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a form of hypnosis, and these words
I have written in my Journal are the absurdities
by which life seduced me from abandoning
it. I am grateful to them and have therefore
preserved them carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history of Mallare&#8217;s madness, however,
is to be found in this Journal. There are
two empty pages that stare significantly. The
empty pages are a lapse. It was during this
lapse that Mallare smiled with interest at the
spectacle of his disintegration. There follows,
then, a sudden excited outburst, undated. In it
the beginnings of his madness pirouette like
tentative dancers.</p>

<p><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Perhaps the greatest miracle is that which
enables man to tolerate life,&rdquo; the passage starts,
&ldquo;which enables him to embrace its illusions
and translate its monstrous incoherence into
delightful, edifying patterns. It is the miracle
of sanity. To stand unquestioning before mysteries,
to remain an undisturbed part of chaos,
ah! what an adjustment! Content and even
elate amid the terrible circle of Unknowns,
behold in this the heroic stupidity of the
sane &hellip; a stupidity which has already outlived
the Gods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man, alas, is the only animal who hasn&#8217;t
known enough to die. His undeveloped senses
have permitted him to survive in the manner
of the oyster. The mysteries, dangers, and
delights of the sea do not exist for the oyster.
Its senses are not stirred by typhoons, impressed
by earthquakes or annoyed by its own insignificance.
Similarly, man!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The complacent egomania of man, his
tyrannical indifferences, his little list of questions
and answers which suffices for his wisdom,
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>these are the chief phenomena or symptoms of
his sanity. He alone has survived the ages by
means of a series of ludicrous adjustments,
until today he walks on two legs&mdash;the crowning
absurdity of an otherwise logical Nature.
He has triumphed by specializing in his weaknesses
and insuring their survival; by disputing
the simple laws of biology with interminable
banalities labelled from age to age as religions,
philosophies and laws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unable, despite his shiftiness, to lie
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'the the'">the</ins> fact of his mortality and decomposition out
of existence, he has satisfied his mania for survival
by the invention of souls. And so behold
him&mdash;spectacle of spectacles&mdash;a chatty little
tradesman in an immemorial hat drifting good-naturedly
through a nightmare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for this ability to exist unnaturally
that he has invented the adjective sane. But
here and there in the streets of cities walk
the damned&mdash;creatures denied the miracle of
sanity and who move bewilderedly through
their scene, staring at the flying days as at the
fragments of another world. They are conscious
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Twenty-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of themselves only as vacuums within
which life is continually expiring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, the damned! From the depths of
their non-existence they contemplate their fellowman
and perceive him a dwarf prostrate
forever before solacing arrangements of words;
an homunculus riding vaingloriously on the
tiny river of ink that flows between monstrous
yesterdays and monstrous tomorrows; a baboon
strutting through a mirage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The history of Mallare&#8217;s madness begins
thus. And the pages continue. The writing on
them seems at a glance part of a decoration in
black and white. The letters are beautifully
formed and shaded. They resemble laboring
serpents, dainty pagodas, vines bearing strange
fruits and capricious bits of sculpture.</p>

<p>To the end Mallare fancied himself aware
of the drift and nuance of his madness. Its convolutions
seemed neither incomprehensible
nor mysterious to him.</p>

<p>An intolerable loathing for life, an illuminated
contempt for men and women, had
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>long ago taken possession of him. This philosophic
attitude was the product of his egoism.
He felt himself the center of life and it became
his nature to revolt against all evidences of life
that existed outside himself. In this manner
he grew to hate, or rather to feel an impotent
disgust for, whatever was contemporary.</p>

<p>When his normality abandoned him, he
avoided a greater tragedy. In a manner it was
not Mallare who became insane. It was his
point of view that went mad. Although there
are passages in the Journal that escape coherence,
the greater part of the entries are simple
almost to naiveté. They reveal an intellect able
to adjust itself without complex uprootings to
the phenomena engaging its energies. The first
concrete evidence of the loathing for life that
was to result in its own annihilation appears in
a passage beginning abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of all I like the trees when they are
empty of leaves. Their wooden grimaces must
aggravate the precisely featured houses of the
town. People who see my work for the first
<a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>time grow indignant and call me sick and artificial.
(Bilious critics!) But so are these trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People think of art in terms of symmetry.
With a most amazing conceit they have decided
upon the contours of their bodies as the standards
of beauty. Therefore I am pleased to look
at trees or at anything that grows, unhandicapped
by the mediocritizing force of reason,
and note how contorted such things are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare&#8217;s point of view toward his world&mdash;the
attitude that went mad&mdash;was nothing more
involved than his egoism. His infatuation with
self was destined to arrive at a peak on whose
height he became overcome with a dizziness.
He wrote in his Journal:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is unfortunate that I am a sculptor, a
mere artist. Art has become for me a tedious
decoration of my impotence. It is clear I should
have been a God. Then I could have had my
way with people. To shriek at them obliquely,
to curse at them through the medium of clay
figures, is a preposterous waste of time. A
wounded man groans. I, impaled by life, emit
statues.</p>

<p><a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;As a God, however, I would have found
a diversion worthy my contempt. I would have
made the bodies of people like their thoughts&mdash;crooked,
twisted, bulbous. I would have given
them faces resembling their emotions and converted
the diseases of their souls into outline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fatuous, little cylindrical creatures
we humans are! With our exact and placid
surfaces that we call beauty. And these grave
and noble houses we erect!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I ought to have been a God. I should
have had my way with people then. I could
have created a world whose horrors would have
remained a consoling flattery to my cynicism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are entries that follow whose significance
is lost in a serpentine rhetoric. They
hint at nights of critical terrors. During the
writing of them Mallare was engaged in a desperate
pursuit of himself. He was escaping.
He perceived his thoughts racing from his
grasp like Maenads down a tangled slope. The
dread of finding himself abandoned brought
his will into life. If he were to go mad he
<a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>would leap upon his mania and ride it&mdash;quietly
into darkness. He would be a gay rider astride
his own phantoms. Rather that than let the
first insane capering of his intellect unhorse
him and leave him gibbering after a vanished
mount.</p>

<p>The incoherence of the Journal suddenly
glides into an adagio. The panic has ended.
And the lifeless eyed man again smiles triumphant
out of the pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My room is red. It is hung with red curtains.
I have bought only red things to put in
it. The sun coming through my red curtains
reddens the air of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer to live in this painted gloom
because it is possible I hate the sunlight. I
hate even my rivals the trees. Today I walked
and found trees that resembled too closely
people passing under them. One is impotent
before such betrayal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But here in my rooms I find an almost
complete annihilation of life. I am bored with
inventing causes for my hatred. There is a
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>diversion on earth called humanity&mdash;creatures
full of enamelled lusts and arrogant decays
who go about smiling and slyly obeying laws
which protect them from each other. But they
no longer divert me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They tell me of health and sanity. And
I say sanity is the determined blindness which
keeps us from seeing one another. More than
that, of course: which keeps us from seeing
ourselves. And health is the lame artifice of
our bodies which keeps us from loathing one
another. I see and I loathe. Yet I must beware
of falling to sleep in explanations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A month or a year may have passed
between this and the continuation. Whatever
the period, a clarity arrived. Mallare&#8217;s mind
grappling with the nightmare shadows engulfing
it, distorted his reason to give them outline
and was saved. The writing, however, becomes
more labored in appearance as if the letters
of words were now decorations in themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have listened for years to the prattle
of men who call themselves egoists. It is a
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>title by which they have sought to identify
me. To label a mystery suffices for its dismissal
and thus they seek to dismiss me. There
is in egoism, however, a depth to which all
but myself are blind. I have found this depth
in myself and out of it rises a definition which
I must consider cautiously. There is but one
egoist and that is He who, intolerant of all
but Himself, sets out to destroy all but Himself.
Egoism is the despairing effort of man
to return to his original Godhood; to return
to the undisputed and triumphant loneliness
which was His when as a Creator He moulded
the world to His whims and before He divided
Himself into the fragments of race and nature.
This is the explanation out of the depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be cautious and keep my eyes
open. Secrets fly from the blind. Mount, I
say, and ride this secret and observe its direction.
To return thus to Godhood means to
destroy All. And I were madder than I am
to play with this prospect, unless, perhaps,
there lie concealed in the elements, chemistries
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>still unknown which might be utilized for
such destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it is, I can with my thought deny
and re-create and impose upon the world of
reality a world of phantoms more pleasing to
my nature. In my red room I sit and give
birth to persuasive horrors. People shaped
like dead trees. People freed from the monotonous
hypocrisy with which a despondent
Nature endows their outlines. I have become
aware that lobsters, beetles, crabs, and all the
crustacean monsters that abound are not the
abnormal accidents of creation, any more than
were the animate gargoyles of prehistoric eras.
They are the things which an Ego intent upon
the diversion of truth fashioned in the beginning.
Each thing to seem as each thing was.
But the courage of this Ego deserted Him and
He grew frightened when He came to give
body to His most useless creation&mdash;Thought.
And He compromised. Yes, I could live
among people fashioned truthfully in their
own images as are the crustaceans.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>With this entry Mallare found it necessary
to destroy the work his hands had created.
He attacked the canvases and figures in his
red room. Goliath who, preoccupied with his
own deformities, had remained indifferent to
his master, serving him faithfully however,
listened to Mallare one night.</p>

<p>Sitting in the center of the room, his black
hair grown into a long slant across his pale
forehead, Mallare talked to his servant as a
man, still asleep, reciting a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here in this room, Goliath,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;are interesting works of art which I am about
to destroy. On the canvases are dithyrambic
burlesques in color, vicious fantasies, despairing
caricatures. My fingers fashioned them
and I remember the pleasant sleep each
brought me. But now I must beware of sleep.
My egomania, like a swollen thing, has become
impossible to articulate or to reduce to the
impotent ironies of clay and paint. But I
must beware of falling asleep under it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends have vanished as naturally
as if by death. I have forbidden them to come.
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>This disturbs them, but see to it, Goliath, that
no one ever enters my room unless I bring
them. Frighten them if they come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tonight, while there remained a little
sanity, I had made up my mind to kill myself.
But I have changed it. I will destroy instead
my work. This is because I find the compromise
easier and the destruction, perhaps, more
interesting. I feel disinclined to abandon the
things I loathe. The world with its nauseous
swarm of life, its monstrous multiplications
which are the eternal insult to the Omniscience
I feel, still holds me. I am caught in a tangle
and I remain suspended and inanimate, in the
depth of a nightmare. But with your aid,
Goliath, I will continue tenaciously mimicking
an outward sanity so that people, when
they see me, will go away happy in the assurance
that I am as stupid as they.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rising from his chair Mallare attacked,
one by one, the canvases and statues. Goliath
watched him in silence as he moved from pedestal
to pedestal from which, like a company
of inert monsters, arose figures in clay and
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Thirty-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bronze. The first of them was a man four
feet in height but massive-seeming beyond
its dimensions. Mallare had entitled it &ldquo;The
Lover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Its legs were planted obliquely on the
pedestal top, their ligaments wrenched into
bizarre muscular patterns. Its body rose in
an anatomical spiral. From its flattened pelvis
that seemed like some evil bat stretched in
flight, protruded a huge phallus. The head of
the phallus was enlivened with the face of a
saint. The eyes of this face were raised in
pensive adoration. At the lower end of the
phallus, the testicles were fashioned in the
form of a short-necked pendulum arrested at
the height of its swing. The hands of the
figure clutched talon-like at the face and the
head was thrown back as if broken at the neck.
Its features were obliterated by the hands
except for the mouth which was flung open
in a skull-like laugh.</p>

<p>The figure on the whole was the flayed
caricature of a man done so cunningly that
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>through the abortive hideousness of its outlines,
its human character remained untouched.</p>

<p>Mallare swung the figure by its base
against the pedestal until it splintered and fell
to pieces. He stood whispering to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the lover. My statue of the
lover. Dead, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dozen similar caricatures in clay and
bronze vanished under his attack. Standing
against the wall and blinking at the rutilant
glare of the room, Goliath the dwarf waited
nervously. He had become aware that his
master was acting strangely. A look of ferocity
slowly came into the deep black of his
face. His misshapen body trembled.</p>

<p>Mallare, the destruction ended, turned to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And finally a last figure,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Goliath, too. Do you agree, Goliath? You
will find a congenial company in the souls of
these friends I have butchered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goliath shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go &#8217;way,&rdquo; he answered. Mallare nodded.</p>

<p><a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-one</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;You reminded me
in time. It is easy to mistake you for one of
my creations. Although I never created such
eyes, improbable eyes alive with murders. Go
to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alone amid the wreckage, Mallare turned
to his Journal. A precise smile was on his
lips and his eyes slanted toward the debris on
the floor as if he were watching the fragments,
fearfully. His hair made a black triangle
against his forehead. He began to write:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too clever to go mad. To go mad
is to succumb to the sanity of others. Since I
avoid death, I must be wary of his misshapen
brother. Yet, I can prove to my satisfaction
tonight that I am mad. I have destroyed something.
It was because the intricate presences
of life awaken too many despairs in me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am alone. I must be cautious of
my thought. I feel words like rivals in my
head. Alas, I must think in words. Words
are the inevitable canonizations of life. But
worse, they are property loaned me and not
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>my own. I must have my own and live with it
entirely. Yet there is some comfort in words.
They are not entirely sullied by their promiscuity.
Words are like nuts people pass each
other without ever opening. The insides of
words are often virginal. But many words&mdash;too
many words&mdash;constitute intelligence and
intelligence is the stupidity which enables man
to imprison himself in lies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years have passed and I still live. I do
not look for death. Death is too simple a
variant of destruction. My cleverness demands
more of me than to destroy the world by hiding
myself from it. And there is a song of
windows in the high streets that sometimes
relieves the black tension of my mind.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;It is important now that I retrace my
way toward a makeshift of Omnipotence. But
for this I will have to find a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/i.png"
 width="143" height="200" alt="I" /><span class="start">t</span> was autumn. The air was
colored like the face of a
sick boy. Upon the streets
rested a windless chill. The
pavements were somber as
during rain. There was an
absence of illusion about
buildings. They stood, high
thrusts of brick, stone and
glass, etched geometrically against a denuded
sky.</p>

<p>Fantazius Mallare walked slowly toward
his home. Over his head, trees without leaves
stamped their gnarled and intricate contours
on the shadowed air. A pallor covered the
roofs. It was afternoon but a moon-like loneliness
haunted the autumn windows.</p>

<p><a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-four</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mallare lived in another world. Neither
trees nor buildings conveyed themselves to his
thought. Within his own world he was sane.
His relation to the phantoms and ideas which
peopled his mind was a lucid one. Mallare&#8217;s
world was his thought. He had retired within
himself, dragging his senses after him.</p>

<p>The street through which he walked was
like an unremembered dream. The faces that
passed him vanished before his eyes. He
walked, seeing nothing that was visible, hearing
nothing that had sound. He had accomplished
an annihilation.</p>

<p>Three months had passed since he had
written in his Journal the command to find a
woman. She was waiting for him now as he
returned to his home. In the three months he
had devoted himself to her transformation.</p>

<p>Mallare no longer raged. In the lucidity
of his thought was a strange lapse. There had
vanished from it all images of life except those
of his own creation. His thought emptied of
its projective sense, he found it difficult for
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>him to translate his ideas in their relation to
the world from which they had escaped. Yet
he wrote in his Journal;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware of something that no longer
lives in my mind. Dim outlines haunt me.
Dead memories peer through the windows of
my tower. Life grimaces vaguely on the edges
of my madness. I can no longer see or understand.
The world is a memory that expires
under my thought. I am alone. Yet how
much of me must still be the world! My dearest
phantoms are, after all, no more than distorted
reminiscences. I fear, alas, this is the
truth. Yet it is pleasant to be alone with one&#8217;s
senses, to feel an independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman awaiting him was a curious
creature. He had found her with a family of
gypsies on the outskirts of the city. She was
young&mdash;eighteen. His money had bought her
release. She was called Rita and after two
weeks she had agreed to come home with him.
An old man in the caravan had said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man is crazy. You can see that by
his eyes and the way he walks. I have listened
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to him for two weeks and I know he is crazy.
But you go with him, Rita. He is lonely and
wants a woman. You go with him and obey
him. You are young and he will teach you.
Perhaps even you will fall in love with him.
You are an ignorant child. Your mind is like
a baby&#8217;s. And perhaps you will not understand
that he is crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the gypsies with whom she had
lived Rita was known as a simple one. She
was never to be trusted to enter the cities they
visited. She would remain with the wagons,
helping to cook and wash. When men came
to her in the evening and, sitting beside her,
sang and played on guitars, she would listen
for a moment and then run off. The old ones
of the caravan said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not grown up. We must treat her
like a child because there is still only a child&#8217;s
heart in her. She is beautiful but without
sense. Some day she will make a good wife.
But there is danger that she may give her body
to strangers. Because she does not know about
such things. We must be careful for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Sitting along the summer roads outside
the city Mallare talked to the child. She listened
without understanding but after days
had passed, dreams of the man with the black
hair slanting across his forehead came to her
when she was alone. So when the Old One of
the caravan said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may go with this stranger. You can
go away if you wish&rdquo;; she nodded and smiled
with happiness.</p>

<p>Mallare brought her home. And she had
lived in the carnelian room that was colored
like the inside of a Burgundy bottle ever since.
Goliath was her slave. Mallare was her God.</p>

<p>At first he had said little to her. She
wanted him to talk but he neither talked nor
paid other attention. He brought her ribbons
and dresses, trinkets, jewels, and playthings.
She had a room in which to sleep but all day
she sat in the room that was hung with heavy
red curtains through which the sun filtered in
a rouged and somber glow. Vermilion fabrics
covered a long couch against the wall. Red
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>carpets, red tapestries, tawny vases of brass
inlaid with niello; crimsons and varying reds
struck an insistent octave of color around her.</p>

<p>Mallare was absent during the days. She
wondered where he went. He would return
in the evenings with gifts. This had continued
for a month. Then had begun a more curious
existence.</p>

<p>One night Mallare had said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must never talk to me any more but
listen always to what I say. If you remain
here you will have everything you wish. But
you must not go outside. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She closed her black eyes and nodded.
He continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire to make something out of you.
If you stay here you will learn what I want
you to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereafter he had sat for days at a time
in the room with her. Goliath brought them
food.</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Forty-nine</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>To Rita the smiling man who never
ceased talking to her became like one of the
Djinns the old ones of the caravan used to tell
stories about, in the nights along the roads.
The words he spoke became a languorous mist
in her ears. She listened and understood only
that this man with the black hair slanted across
his forehead and the silent eyes, was talking to
her. This made her happy.</p>

<p>At night she slept alone dreaming of the
sound of his voice. Her heart became filled
with awe. The strange room with its red colors
was a Temple such as she had heard about
but never seen. Mallare was a God who sat
in its center and around whom grew a world
of mysteries.</p>

<p>When she awoke her heart grew eager.
Perhaps he would let her sit closer to him this
new day. Perhaps his hands would touch her
hair. She dreamed that some time he would
play a guitar and sing to her as the men of the
caravan used to do. But if that happened she
would not run away as before. She would
draw close to him and kiss his hands.</p>

<p><a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But the two months had passed without
change. Except that the days became for Rita
only the sound of a voice in her heart and the
image of a face staring out of her secret
thoughts.</p>

<p>She wore fine clothing. Rings crowded
her fingers until her hands seemed little effigies
of themselves. Her black hair was looped over
her ears. A gold band was around it. She
would have been happy if he had sat closer to
her while he talked. Then the mystery of the
words he spoke would not have separated
them. Now she could lie on the couch, her
head on her hand, her eyes burning and watch
his lips move.</p>

<p>Her mind never asked what he was saying.
His words carried him away. They were
part of the mystery of him. Out of them she
gleaned fugitive meanings as one recognizes
for an instant familiar faces in a passing
crowd. But she was content to lie watching
him. A lethargy filled her. The days were
like parts of a dream. At night, alone, she lay
<a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>awake remembering them as a child playing
with delicious fantasies.</p>

<p>She was asleep on the couch when Mallare
came in. Goliath shuffled away as his
master appeared. He had been standing in the
center of the room, staring at the sleeping
Rita, his eyes rolled up and his huge black
head rigid.</p>

<p>She woke and Mallare smiled at her. Her
eyes grew large and her red lips parted.</p>

<p>Mallare, seating himself, studied her with
calm. She was his creation. He was giving
her life. His mind was beginning to conceive
her as a part of the phantoms that lived in him
and that were his world. This illusion diverted
him. His objective sense fast vanishing, he
was gradually perceiving her as a tangible
outline of his own hallucinations.</p>

<p>She was no longer the childish-minded
gypsy girl he had found with the caravan. She
was a fantasy of Mallare. There was no body
to her but the body of his curious thoughts. A
silent and adoring image of his brain stared
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>back at him from the vermilion couch. This
pleased him.</p>

<p>His madness had translated her into his
inner world. At moments a gleam of doubt disturbed
his illusion. As he talked a consciousness
of her eyes would tangle his words. Her
eyes would become two dark intruders, and he
would rise and walk away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be careful,&rdquo; he would mutter
nervously.</p>

<p>Away from her the illusion would leave
him and his thought would consider lucidly
the situation it had created.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My madness plays with a dangerous
toy,&rdquo; he pondered. &ldquo;She is a woman and her
eyes are filled with desire. Perhaps she has not
even understood the things I have told her. I
must be careful, however, not to betray my
illusions with this lingering sanity. When I
am with her I conceive her a phantom&mdash;a
something which has stepped out of my madness
to divert it. Her body becomes like one
of the dreams in my brain. Her little hands
<a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>reach like cobra heads among my intimacies.
She is very beautiful that way. In my mind I
caress her as a part of myself. I speak to her
and it seems as if my words are talking to each
other. Yet her eyes intrude and frighten me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, as he studied her, the illusion he
desired again filled him. His eyes turned
inward saw only a dark-eyed phantom, a
woman of mist that was no more than a hallucination
drifting through his thought. He
addressed this image of Rita softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pleasant to be in love with you,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Because love hitherto has been one of
the abominations. In the world I have
destroyed love existed. It was the foul paradox
of egoism. Man, feeling suddenly the
torment of his incompleteness, embraced
woman. He was inspired by the mania to transform
his desires into possessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His heart taunted him. His brain filled
with despairing vacuums. And he said to himself,
&lsquo;I have become a deserted room. A woman
will enter. Her beauty and desire will be gifts
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that will furnish me once more. She will be
something I possess within myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this illusion was contained the foul
paradox of egoism. For in the world I have
destroyed, egoism died in the embrace of love.
The mania for possession which flattered man
into seeking woman was no more than a
shrewd mirage of his senses, that tricked him
into the fornications necessary only incidentally
to himself but vital to the world which he
fancied love obliterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all these strenuous admirations of
beauty&mdash;what are they but the subterfuges by
which man hopefully conceals his lacking
egoism from himself? He admires the tints of
hair. His thought trembles before the curve
of a neck. Graceful images unravel in his
mind at the sight of a woman&#8217;s breasts. To
himself he declaims, &lsquo;I am in love with her.
She is beautiful. I will take her beauty in my
arms. There is an emptiness in me that clamors
for the charm and mystery of this woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-five</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Accordingly he embraces her. There
is tenderness between them. Their bodies,
indeed, seem to have become overtones that
mate in a delicious and inaudible melody. But
this melody must be brought closer so that its
beauty may be more definitely enjoyed. This
melody must be played on instruments and not
on thin air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, selah! The egoist beautifying himself
with love, finds himself removing his
shoes, tearing off his underwear, fondling a
warm thigh and steering his phallus toward
its absurd destiny. The transvaluations&mdash;the
ineffable and inarticulate mysteries he fancied
himself embracing&mdash;turn out to be a
woman with her legs wrapped around him.
His desires for the infinite sate themselves in
the feeble tickle of orgasm. Cerberus seduced
from his Godhood by a dog biscuit!</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for those animals whose egoism has
never escaped their testicles, they are not to be
spoken of as men. Their imagination discharges
itself through their penis. They are
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the husbands in the world I have destroyed.
They understand neither beauty nor disillusion.
The vagina is a door at which they
deliver regularly like industrious milkmen.
They are the sexual workmen to whom fornication
is as much a necessity as poverty is to
incompetents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I alone have found the way in which to
love. I love and grow richer. I am mad. Yet
how admirable my madness is! My eyes and
senses are enslaved by a radiant phantom. As
I talk your outlines grow luminous. Your eyes
become like conquered Satans. They crawl
inside my brain like amorous spiders. Your
lips are the libretto of a dream. Your breasts
are little blind faces raised in prayer. Your
body flutters like a rich curtain before the door
of enchantments. I look within. Thus I possess
you and my senses without leaving themselves,
enter the infinity of my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare&#8217;s eyes closed. He remained rigid
in his chair. A murmur that Rita could no
<a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>longer hear came from his lips, as if voices
were speaking out of a depth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rita &hellip; Rita,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;See, eyes
prowling like golden tigers. Cobra hands
playing over my soul. Mine &hellip; I walk with
you through gardens, deeper and endless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The murmur ended. Rita, watching from
the couch, lay trembling. Warm tongues
spoke within her body. Her breasts tightened
until they felt impaled on their own nipples.
Her child&#8217;s mind was alive with impulses
driving her like slow whips. She would crawl
shivering to his feet. Her breasts would press
their pain against his knees. Desire like an impossible
anger filled her. She closed her eyes
and felt herself moving from the couch. She
would lie at his feet.</p>

<p>Her hands reached out. Mallare regarded
her blankly for a moment. A wildness slowly
filled his eyes. He sprang up. Goliath crouching
in a corner of the dim room watched his
master raise the velveted figure in his hands
and fling it with a cry against the wall.</p>

<p><a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Fifty-eight</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Intruder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goliath cringed as his master rushed past
him to the door. He listened to his feet flying
down the stairs toward the night.</p>

<p>Rita lay with her head hanging over the
couch. Her lips were opened. Her teeth
gleamed like little deaths. She lay motionless
as Mallare had flung her.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Goliath shuffled to the couch. His huge
black face stared over her closed eyes.</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/h.png"
 width="142" height="200" alt="H" /><span class="start">e remembered</span> that he
had thrown the girl against
the wall and he paused. The
street was black. Great shadows
balanced themselves on
his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have escaped from
myself,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>He stood trying to remember himself. But
his mind was like a night. Shapes tip-toed
through its dark. A hooded figure loomed in
his mind. It swung toward him as if it were
flying out of his eyes. Other figures swept by.
They assumed strange postures as they passed.
His thoughts regarded them tiredly. He
<a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>desired to join the figures fleeing out of him.
Then he would vanish with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too clever for that,&rdquo; he murmured
aloud. &ldquo;Yet it would be pleasing. To think in
dark, hooded figures; ah&mdash;they have adventures!
And I would sit like a night alive with
witches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared with a smile at the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I no longer see or understand,&rdquo; he whispered.
His hands felt his sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet here I am. There is a life within me
that I dare not enter. I must remember this.
Write &lsquo;Forbidden&rsquo; over its black doors. To
succumb to my madness would be to lose it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He resumed his walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She intruded,&rdquo; he remembered. &ldquo;Perhaps
I have killed her. That would be pleasant.
Except that she was necessary as an image.
I am the mirror and she is an image alive in
me. Her desire is a happy shadow I embrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare&#8217;s eyes opened to the night.</p>

<p><a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-one</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I see and yet what
I look at remains invisible. But tonight outlines
dance. The night is a maniac suffering
from ennui. His dark eyes are weary with the
emptiness they create. Vainly he searches for
life, his eyes devouring it, and leaving only his
own image for him to contemplate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so mad as that. Or I, too, would
sit like the night gorged with monotonous shadows.
Instead, I translate. A memory of sanity
gives diverting outline to the shadows in me.
I am not a maniac like the night. My mind
closes like a darkness over the world but I
enjoy myself walking amid insane houses, staring
at windows that look like drunken octagons,
observing lamp posts that simper with evil,
promenading fan shaped streets that scribble
themselves like arithmetic over my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These must be the things I look at. But
they are my improvement. The world is not so
outrageous if one is sufficiently mad to pull it
into taffy shapes and incredible scrawls.</p>

<p><a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But I must be warned. My madness
sought to avenge itself at her intrusion. It overcame
me with its anger. She was not content
to let me possess the beautiful image of her.
Although I have explained the thing to her
clearly. It is possible she does not understand.
I will talk to her again with greater lucidity.
I will tell her that I do not desire her except
as a dream for my mirror. But I have said that
to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the green-white sputter of a street
lamp, Mallare halted. His mind was preoccupied
with unraveling the mystery of Rita. He
stood, a tall figure without a hat, a slant of black
hair across his forehead, and ignoring eyes.
A beggar in a ragged overcoat shuffled, head
down, toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is only a child,&rdquo; Mallare thought,
&ldquo;but it is evident that passion already lifts her
breasts. Her simplicity is betrayed by incipient
orgasms prowling for an outlet. This, she fancies,
is love. It is fortunate she is a virgin. Still,
I must not rely too greatly on that. For virginity
is an insidious bed fellow for a maiden.
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Forefingers and phallic shadows have ravished
her in dreams. And if she is a virgin in spirit
as well as body, she is still a woman&mdash;and therefore
dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, what loathsome and lecherous mouths
women are! Offering their urine ducts as a
mystic Paradise! Stretching themselves on
their backs and seducing egoists with the unctuous
lie of possession. The mania for possession&mdash;that
most refined of all instincts&mdash;the
most heroic of insanities! How easily they circumvent
it! To desire is merely to love. But
to create in oneself the objects of desire&mdash;that
is to be mad and above life. Beyond it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must explain this to her. If she loves
me well enough she will understand. All things
are possible in love. I will explain to her that
I possess her at will without the loathsome
absurdities of sex.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beggar paused and mumbled beside
Mallare. Watery, reddened eyes waited
patiently for the alms asked. Mallare had fallen
into silence. He stood regarding the beggar
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>intently. His thought labored for a moment,
scratching in silence at doors swinging slowly
shut. His thought withdrew and Mallare was
alone.</p>

<p>He stood up tall and stern in a darkened
chamber. His eyes stared intently at the figure
of Rita. Her face, pale and alive, smiled
imploring in the mendicant&#8217;s place. He talked,
but the beggar, still patient, heard no sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have followed me,&rdquo; said Mallare
inside his chamber. &ldquo;Very well. It is useless
to explain matters to you. You pursue me with
your lecherous body. I have warned you. Now
I will kill you. I will take your throat in my
hands and that will be an end of you. You will
fall down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beggar uttered a cry of terror. Mallare&#8217;s
hands had reached suddenly to his throat
and their fingers, like inviolable decisions,
closed on it. The ragged one screamed. A man
with a slant of black hair across his forehead
who had stood smiling at him had without
sound or warning reached out his hands to
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>murder him. The beggar gasped and writhed,
his eyes staring with horror into the immobile
face of his assailant. And within himself Mallare
continued the strange conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how simple it is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After
you are dead I will continue to enjoy for a time
the uninterrupted image of you. You will
haunt my thought until you grow dim. But I
will possess the vanishing shadow&hellip;. But
now you die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare tightened his hold on the beggar&#8217;s
neck and the man&#8217;s cries ended. His head fell
forward. Mallare held the dead figure erect,
shaking it gently and smiling at the one in his
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Rita,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it is over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hands released the throat they were
holding. The beggar fell to the ground. Mallare
stared at the body and then knelt beside
it. His hands passed over the dead face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Rita,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;No longer
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-six</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He bent over and kissed the matted hair
of the dead man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death,&rdquo; he said aloud as he rose, &ldquo;is an
easy friendship. You would have been sorry a
moment ago. But now you are neither sorry
nor glad. See, your body is a humble little
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mallare walked away. His thought, like
a cautious monitor, re-entered the doors that
had closed upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;she followed me
and I killed her. Madness is, alas, too logical.
I remember almost nothing of the incident. It
is a part of the shadows not of me. Still I know
it exists. My hands feel tired. But there is
nothing to regret. She came too close. And
now she lies dead in a strange street. They will
find her and perhaps ask me about it. What do
I know? Nothing. My memory is innocent. It
is after all my superior. I must remain, unquestioning,
at its side. This is a pact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He returned to his home. The familiar
room greeted him like a friendship. He sat
<a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>down and closed his eyes. Goliath had gone to
bed. And she was no longer here.</p>

<p>His hands felt tired. He was alone again.
But he would remember her. Eyes like conquered
Satans. They would crawl again like
spiders through his brain. Breasts like little
blind faces raised in prayer. Her body fluttering
like a rich curtain before the door of
enchantments. These were still his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, Rita,&rdquo; he murmured aloud to
his thoughts.</p>

<p>A figure stirred on the couch. She had
watched him come in, his hair disheveled, his
body dragging. Her eyes had followed him as
he sat down. But she had waited motionless.
Perhaps he had come back to kill her. She lay
shivering. Then his voice called her name.</p>

<p>Standing slowly, Rita waited. He was
asleep but he had called her. She moved cautiously
over the heavy carpet. Mallare opened
his eyes. He looked at the burning-eyed figure
of the girl his hands remembered having killed
in the strange street.</p>

<p><a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-eight</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;A hallucination,&rdquo; his thought muttered.
&ldquo;But the dead do not come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene under the green-white street
lamp played its swift detail through his mind
again. He remembered the white throat, the
pale, imploring face. A shudder passed his
heart. He had murdered her. Yet here she
stood once more, looking at him.</p>

<p>Mallare smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Mad, completely mad.
Yet it is not as unpleasant as I feared. Why,
indeed, am I startled? This is what I desired.
To create for myself out of myself. And here
my phantoms have become so rich and strong
that they confront me. I desired to be God.
And I have answered my own prayer. It is an
illusion. Its substance is only the life my madness
gives it. Yet I, who am the companion of
my madness, may enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rita shivered again as he laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come closer,&rdquo; he whispered to her. &ldquo;Or
are you too timorous a hallucination, Rita?
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Sixty-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Come closer and let me see. What a curious
sensation! To caress the figures of my madness!
Then there is no longer any sanity in me. For
my fingers are aware of hair. Ah, dear child,
Mallare is completely mad since at last his
senses betray him. But they betray him sweetly.
For though I babble to myself you have no
existence, though I smile at the thought of
caressing a phantom, my senses derive a mysterious
pleasure from this contact with nothingness.
Curious &hellip; curious &hellip; come
closer, Rita. Now smile at me. Yes, your lips
move. You are an automaton born of my words.
Give me your hand. It is warm and trembling.
Ah, my phantom is in love with me. But that
love, too, is an illusion I create. No, do not
come too close. Let me grow accustomed first
to my madness. You are happy, eh? How marvelous
your eyes! They were beautiful before
when they crawled like round spiders through
my brain. But elusive. They fled from me,
my madness pursuing them into dark, empty
corners.</p>

<p><a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But now I have grown cleverer. It is
necessary to be superbly clever in order to fool
one&#8217;s senses like this. But take off your clothes,
little one. I want to see how clever I am. Has
my phantom a body, too, or is it only a face and
an illusion of fabric I have created? Your velvet
dress, Rita, take it off. Ah, what a virginal
phantom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rita, trembling before the gleam of the
eyes that had opened to her, listened anxiously.
An ecstasy drifted like a cloud over her senses.
He had touched her. His hands had passed
over her head as she had dreamed they might.
His eyes were smiling with intimacy at her
face. But he had warned her never to speak.
She must not spoil it by speaking. She stood
swaying before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your velvet dress,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>Her hands reached dreamily to her body.
He would see now how beautiful she was. The
men in the caravan had called her beautiful.
But she had run from them. That was long
ago. Now she would show him how the skin
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of her body looked, how her breasts made pretty
curves, and how she had washed herself in the
perfumes he had given her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured Mallare, his eyes filling
with wonder. &ldquo;How incredibly clever my madness
has become! My little phantom undresses.
Illusion&mdash;yet my conveniently stupid senses are
deceived. But what delicious deception! See,
her throat and breasts are white. Her body is
white. I may reach out and touch the flesh of
her thighs. I am as indecent as God for I have
given her sex. But what a plagiarist I am! My
phantom is as charming and naive as an art
student&#8217;s copy. Still, she is not a woman and
therefore not hateful. Without life, even this
may be considered entertaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His hands moved cautiously over her body,
his fingers slipping experimentally over the
flesh of her buttocks and thighs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Like St.
Anthony I create <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'obalisques'">odalisques</ins> for my seduction.
Ah, but there is a difference. This is mine &hellip;
mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>His eyes gleamed with a quick frenzy at
the naked figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak. I desire you to speak, little one.
If I can believe in the illusion of flesh and eager
eyes, then I can believe in the illusion of sound.
Come speak. I am at the mercy of my madness.
If you speak to me, little one, I will understand.
My stupid senses that retain their earthly
logic will be ravished at the sound of your voice.
But I will chuckle at my cleverness. Tell me,
are you mine? Can you say, &lsquo;I am yours&rsquo;? Can
you give yourself to me and deceive me with
the beautiful illusion of submission? Tell me.
Speak to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes burning toward him, Rita nodded
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Whatever you
say, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clever, clever,&rdquo; Mallare muttered, &ldquo;it
speaks to me and I hear. It says &lsquo;yours.&rsquo; I
become too involved. Or perhaps this is only
a dream. Of course, what else can it be? Part
of me has fallen asleep and is dreaming. And
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>because I am mad I fancy myself awake. And
my senses obey me. Desire whispers to them,
&lsquo;Hear voices. See flesh. Feel desire,&rsquo; and like
five little awkward masochists they prostrate
themselves before my madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my senses are of no great interest.
There is this other&mdash;this mania of possession of
which passion, compounded of all the senses, is
but an unimportant fragment. I am a man with
a woman inside him. I possess the secret of the
hermaphroditic Gods. I am complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rita kneeled beside him and his hands
stroked her black hair. Her face remained
raised in adoration. Mallare, observing her
eyes, nodded satisfactions at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who but Mallare could have done this?&rdquo;
he whispered aloud to her. &ldquo;Mallare, infatuated
with himself, desires still a further adoration.
So he creates infatuated phantoms. I am
tired now. My hands are tired. Return, little
one, to the couch of my madness and sleep for
a time in its shadows.&ldquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-four</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Mallare shut his eyes and his hands
dropped to his side. Rita arose and smiled at
him. He had spoken strangely, but his words
were no longer mysteries since he had caressed
her. She would lie now at his feet as she had
dreamed of doing. She stretched herself out
on the thick carpet.</p>

<p>Her childish mind fondled its unexpected
memories. He had looked at her body and
spoken beautiful words to it. She remembered
the talk of the old ones of the caravan. A
woman belongs to a man. This meant that she
belonged to him. She had said, &ldquo;Yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Her face smiled itself to sleep.</p>

<p class="start"><i><img class="initial" src="images/f.png"
 width="143" height="200" alt="F" /><span class="start">rom</span> the Journal of Mallare
dated November.</i></p>

<p class="top2">&ldquo;I no longer understand
myself. My thoughts stretch
themselves into baffling elasticities.
My brain is a labyrinth
through which reason
searches in vain for itself. I walk cautiously.
Yet I am lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think has become like adding a continually
increasing column of figures. I sit and
add. The figures will add up into a finite sum
and this sum will be the understanding of
myself. I apply myself carefully to each figure
<a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and say, &lsquo;two and three are five. Five and
seven are twelve.&rsquo; But as I reach what seems
an end I find more figures waiting me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can no longer add up the fragments or
interpret them. I must be content now to sit
and wait until this part of me&mdash;my relation to
myself&mdash;splinters into fragments and I become
a dice box shaking with mysterious and invisible
combinations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the phantom Rita that is threatening
to drive me into darkness. Since I murdered
her in the street, the hallucination has become
overwhelming. It is with me almost continually.
When I open my eyes from sleep I find
it waiting at my bed. The hallucination leaves
me when I am outside, although at times a trace
of it returns and I seem more to feel its presence
within me than behold it with my senses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am clinging desperately to these
moments of objectivity which enable me to
write. But even they threaten to betray me. For
as I write doubts dance like macabre figures
among my words. The very sentences seem to
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>stretch themselves into ridiculous postures.
And I must almost close my eyes and stumble
blindly through a storm of denouements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desired to create for myself a world
within which I might love and hate&mdash;to be a
God lost within his dream. Madness was necessary,
so I embraced it. But my dream becomes
the product of a Frankenstein. She&mdash;the hallucination&mdash;is
more real to my senses than am
I. And I can no longer control her. My senses
are unfaithful to me. They philander clownishly
with this mirage of my thought. Then
what is there left? I. This grim figure stumbling
with his head down through a storm of
denouements. I persist&mdash;an unwelcome visitor,
a bargain-hunting tourist in Bedlam. I remain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is a boast that laughs back at me.
For I will soon be a little plaything of my
phantom. Last night I walked until I thought
I had rid myself. Her eyes alone lingered. Her
hands moved like slow dancers. But I walked
and said to myself, &lsquo;I am tired of nonsense. I
am tired of this monotonous hallucination. At
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>least let me be unfaithful to my dream since I
am the God who created it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked to the street where a month ago
she had followed me under the arc lamp. It
was cold and I grew tired. I came back to sleep.
&lsquo;Gone, she is gone,&rsquo; I whispered to myself. The
room appeared empty. I was cautious, knowing
the ruses of this thing in my mind. For my
madness and I are no longer friends. My madness
hides for me and plays tricks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she returned. I smiled at her. It is
folly to grow angry with one&#8217;s own hallucinations.
That would be a double madness. As
she stood before me, my treacherous senses
leaped to their sterile feast. And I smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My egoism has betrayed me,&rsquo; I reasoned.
&lsquo;The love that gleams from the eyes of
this hallucination is the invention of my egoism.
Alas, I love myself too much, for the
passion for Mallare with which my madness
endows this illusion of a woman, threatens me.
My senses have already abandoned me. They
no longer obey the direction of my will. And
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Seventy-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I must stand like a scold, laughing and sneering
at them as they yield themselves to her.
She is more powerful, therefore, than I, even
though her existence is no more than a shadow
cast in front of my eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reasoned in this fashion and continued
to smile. It would be best, perhaps, to humor
her. Who knows but even hallucinations are
subject to wiles and coquetry. A disturbing
fancy, this&mdash;one of the distortions that insist
upon raising their mocking heads from the
midst of my cautious sentences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came and knelt beside me and I
shook my head at her. She was dressed in a
gown I had never seen before. It was red. I
spoke aloud and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See, how abominably clever I am. My
madness is a jack of all trades. It makes new
dresses for its phantoms. It arranges their
coiffures. It even puts rouge on their <ins class="TN" title="Transcribers' note:
 original paragraph ends with a superfluous double quote">cheeks.&rsquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;But as I talked her hands reached out to
me. To look into her eyes that are always alive
with flames is to succumb. For then I find
<a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>myself dreaming my dream is not a dream.
My senses clamor that I join them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forget. Forget,&rsquo; they whisper, &lsquo;come
with us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I chose to persist. I remain. To sit
in an empty whorehouse and masturbate&hellip;.
No! If this hallucination grows powerful
enough to trick my senses into clownish fornications,
let my madness enjoy them. Not I.
We are no longer friends, my madness and I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She pressed her cheek against my leg. I
could feel her body trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remained motionless and spoke to her.
&lsquo;Each night you grow bolder,&rsquo; I said. I am no
different from other Gods in that I seem to
have endowed you with the instinct of profanation.
But at least Eve did not turn on
Jehovah with the whore tricks learned from
His apple. There is consolation, however, in
the fact that I, too, can remain indifferent.
Indifference is the wisdom of God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may play with me. Yet I know
that the burn of your hand on my body is an
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>absurdity, of interest only to my idiot senses.
My arms reach out to embrace you. Your
breasts surprise my fingers. Come, sit in my
lap if you wish. No, I would rather enjoy you
as before&mdash;standing before me naked. Take off
your clothes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I talked she clung to me. Her lips
passed kisses over my face. I continued, however,
to observe; to remain a spectator. She
removed her clothes, tearing them from her
body and laughing. And standing before me
naked but for her black silk stockings and red
slippers, she held out her arms. But I shook
my head and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am the victim of an overwhelming
desire to masturbate,&rsquo; I said to her, &lsquo;since I find
it difficult to resist you. But if I yield to the
mysterious reality you have assumed I will
become too grotesque for my vanity to tolerate.
I will remain aware while possessing you that
my penis is beating a ludicrous tattoo on a
sofa cushion. I choose rather to emulate the
pride of St. Anthony, who shrewdly refused to
play the whoremonger with shadows.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I smiled at her and she laughed. She
crouched on her feet staring up at me. Raising
my eyes from her, I saw Goliath. He was standing
in the curtains of his room, watching me
with a curious, open-mouthed fury. I saw that
the little monster was beginning to understand
that I was mad, and this irritated me. There
was danger in him, since even through his
stupid head must have passed a wonder of what
had happened to Rita.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I frowned at Goliath and his head rolled
frightenedly on his heavy shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you bother me when I wish
to be alone?&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;Go to your bed and
leave me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stood up and went for him. His head
fell and he dragged himself back into his room.
This was, perhaps, the most curious thing in
the incident. &lsquo;I am ashamed of being seen with
this nude phantom,&rsquo; I thought. For a moment
the mad idea came to me that she was visible to
Goliath&mdash;that he was watching us&mdash;me and
this figment of mine. My anger was shame.
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>My senses are logical in their pretenses. How
can I stand out against them, if they grow
cleverer than I, more persuasive than I, and
lead me finally into the total madness of accepting
them as Mallare&mdash;the one Mallare, the
lunatic who has escaped himself? I must not
escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I returned she was still crouching
on the floor. I decided to experiment. Perhaps
there was still some lingering sense in me that
would fail to succumb to this astonishing
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'makebelieve'">make-believe</ins>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come here. On the couch,&rsquo; I ordered her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She obeyed. She stretched herself out
and I sat beside her. The odor of her body was
distinct. Perfumes spread a clever gloss over
the woman smell, the bitter salt odor that stirred
from between her closed thighs. I smiled, for
the logic of this illusion grows entertaining.
But I had decided on experiments. My hands
stroked her hair, feeling of its strands. My
fingers pressed at the skull beneath the warm
skin of her head. Then I held her breasts, that
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>had once seemed to me like two little blind
faces raised in prayer. But imagery no longer
decorates my thought. My hallucination is no
longer a weaver of magical phrases. But stark,
real&mdash;its heart beating under ribs, its skin
glowing with perspiration, its nipples standing
out. As I caressed her I heard her say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yours. Yours. I am your woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her thighs opened and her arms that had
been held toward me fell to her sides. My
hand slipped between. There was warm flesh.
Yes, it was flesh to my mind. And I sat for
moments allowing the illusion to stir a passion
in me. I would throw myself on this thing,
hold it in my arms, give myself to it. Where
was the wrong in that, since it was only myself
I ravished&mdash;a phantom mocking me behind
my eyes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goliath saved me. I saw him standing
once more in the curtains of his room. His
long arms were beating against his sides, the
black fingers opening and shutting like frantic
talons. He stood with his head rolling as if he
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>were trying to stand erect. His eyes were
insane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sprang away, again pulled by the unmistakable
emotion of shame. He glared at me
for a moment, but as my hand caught his face
he toppled over and lay whining. I picked
him up and threw him into his bed and locked
the door of his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I returned she still lay. Her eyes
were closed. She looked at me and I saw she
was weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Since you are not to be reasoned out of
existence, since you seem to resist what is left
of my sanity&mdash;there is nothing to do but tolerate
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat in my chair and spoke to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It will end in my loathing you,&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;I created you in order to possess you beyond
the realism of the senses. For a time your body
was like a rich curtain before the door of
enchantments which I might enter at will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But there is no longer a door. Your body
alone confronts me. In this way I am reduced
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to enjoying my dream with my senses. Then it
means only that I have achieved nothing more
by my madness than the privilege of masturbating
with the aid of an erotic phantom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas, the reason of it is clear. Man&#8217;s
fiber is fouled throughout with sex. I sought
to emancipate myself from all relation to life.
The delusion of my hopes is more to be pitied
than the disorder of my vanity. For I see now
that man is a collection of adjectives loaned to a
phallus. His intellect is no more than a diverting
hiatus between fornications. His soul, yes,
his very egoism on which he prides himself, is
a synthetic erection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To possess! What a delusion! And for
its sake I threw my genius away. I stripped the
world from my eyes that it might not intrude
upon the universe within me. A paradise in
which I might strut alone. Possess myself. Yes,
and here I am, aware at last of folly. For my
senses belong to life. And though I buried
myself in a madness deeper than night, they
would still cling to me. Though I castrated
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>myself, they would remain&mdash;five invisible testicles.
It is impossible to possess. Folly to
attempt. As long as the senses remain life clings
like a dead whore to my darkness. Even my
madness that I prided myself upon is a babbling
witch astride a phallus, her lips bending
over it with grewsome hungers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is only one castration&mdash;death.
What am I now? Mad? Yes. And worse.
Disillusioned. I have closeted myself with a
lecherous animal and it turns on me. That is
the reward of the privacy I hungered after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you who lie and weep on a couch
are no longer the dream of a God, but the crude
marionette created by lust for its own diversion.
I thought only to go mad. But I see I
have become an idiot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no more to say. Her weeping
ended and she vanished. But she will return.
In my sleep her outline wanders like an amorous
ghost haunting the grave of my senses. Ah,
I must be cautious now, more cautious, always
cautious. It would be too easy to yield. And if
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Eighty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>I yielded and returned again my defeat would
be unbearable. I think it is easier to die. Death
is no more than a premature torment. Its name
alone is a suffering. Its reality but a final
illusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I persist. I still remain. There is a
rhythm to things that still seduces me. A gentle
curiosity that gives the lie to my bewilderment.
I sit, an audience, shedding crocodile tears at
a melodrama.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Tomorrow &hellip; tomorrow. Who can
think that word is still himself? What difference
does it make if I grow uncomfortable and
swollen with illusions? I persist. And who
knows but tomorrow will be a door in my labyrinth &hellip;
a bottom to this pit into which I
have fallen?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="top2">&ldquo;Her murder was simple.
We stood under an arc
lamp and my hands killed
her. I remember her face
looking imploringly at me.
And when I went away I leaned over and
kissed her hair. She was dead in the street. It
was simple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I must kill again. It is no longer
simple. I must teach her to hate me. She will
vanish then. It is clear in my thought. My
hands are useless against her now. I have held
them about her neck and she laughs.</p>

<p><a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;All day she runs around in the room. At
night she comes to my bed. Her hands wake
me up. She plays with me. I lie thinking how
she may be murdered this second time. She
has grown loathsome. I allow her to cover my
body with kisses and listen to her laughter.
Pollutions result. I am powerless against her
lips and terrible fingers. She devours me night
after night like a succubus. I lie and masturbate
with a phantom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I will discover a way to kill this
thing. I close my eyes and lie powerless while
she repeats the refrain I once taught her.
&lsquo;Yours &hellip; yours. I am your woman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have hurled her out of bed, hurled her
body against the wall. She continues to laugh
like a child. I think of her as real. Goliath
knows I am mad. He watches me while I struggle
with this thing. He is filled with terror. I
have told him to go, but he remains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sleeps in the bed that Rita used. I
have seen her there. Stood beside her listening
to her breathe. If I die she will pursue me in
<a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>death. She is more real than I. I must kill her.
My hands have never touched her since the
night on the couch. I have kept myself intact.
I still remain. She is a virgin. My thought is
mad. It plays with the idea of fornication.
Once, screams frightened her out of my bed. I
lay unable to resist. My body reached toward
her. An anger that was like death blinded me.
I cried out and saved myself. My thought crept
back from the madness. I called myself back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can no longer close my eyes to her. She
grimaces in the dark. And she is at my heels in
the street. I have decided there is a way to rid
myself of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mallare &hellip; Mallare is no more. Madness
jostles him off the scene. He annihilated
a world and a new monster sprang up in its
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My words return. Ah, tired warriors
covered with the grime of battle&mdash;they troop
back to my mind out of the dark. Mallare
returns. But what a caricature! See him like
a fanatic priest driving the devil out of his
soul with whips.</p>

<p><a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;This would be a God, this hermaphroditic
prostitute who fondles himself at night. Mallare
&hellip; weep. Whips will not rid you of
this monster. Mallare, the plaything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is a way to be rid of her. Hate
will darken the gleam of her body. She will
vanish. But do I hate her? My madness is
infatuated since it makes her so radiant. And
who am I that I laugh at my madness? It is I
who am insane. Not this other Eden maker
whose mania I applauded. I, Mallare, tear at
my hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look in the mirror over my bed. Eyes
red and gleaming look back at me. This is my
face, but I am no longer there. And whose are
these eyes looking back at me? The eyes of
Mallare&#8217;s friend, red and gleaming. His friend
who betrayed him. Hair slanting over a forehead.
Mouth wide and thin. No longer mine.
They belong to the mirror. Mallare&#8217;s words
whimper before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weep &hellip; weep, impotent one. The
feet of your madness walk solemnly over you.

 </span>They kick gravely at a carcass. Lie beneath
them and watch Mallare dance away, whirl
away with lecherous shadows in his arms. But
she will die too. I am thinking of death. Mallare
the egoist asks alms of death!</p>

broken windows. I am gone and away. Empty

of darkness. Pity him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/s.png"
 width="142" height="200" alt="S" /><span class="start">he</span> sat looking out of the
window. He had gone away
early in the morning. It was
growing dark now. The
cold street dwindled. Windows
lighted up. People
that looked from the distance
like black toys moved
through the darkening street.</p>

<p>She could tell when he came because his
walk was different. The hours built pointed
roofs to her dream. She played behind happy
walls but her eyes remained outside, watching
from the window.</p>

<p>This was part of a game&mdash;to hide away
and wait. To put on her clothes carefully in
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the morning; bright silks and petticoats and a
dress on top; jewels on her fingers; bracelets
and earrings; gold bands through her hair. To
make her cheeks red and paint black lines in
her eyes; then paint her lips and fingers red&mdash;these
things hid her. She must be hidden when
he came&mdash;concealed behind paints and clothes
so that when he looked at her it would be someone
else he saw.</p>

<p>A tall man with black hair. His face was
white. His eyes were silent and hidden. But
when they looked at her they screeched like
parrots. They ruffled up and yellow points
came into them.</p>

<p>He liked to walk up and down pretending
she was nowhere, pretending there was no Rita,
pretending he was looking for her. Then she
ran around and one by one she took off the
things&mdash;the dress, the petticoats, the silks, the
jewels and bracelets and gold bands. Each one
she took off was for him. It was a game. She
came out of hiding places. Each one she took
off was a secret she confessed to him.</p>

<p><a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She sat at the window dreaming of the
ways she belonged to him. Her thought was a
pantomime which prostrated itself before his
memory. She remembered sacrifices&hellip;. He
would lie cold in his bed. Then she crawled to
his side. She dared not look at his eyes. They
were above her and kept themselves hidden.
She vanished before the thought of them.</p>

<p>Then his body grew warm under her
hands. Her lips made his body tremble. He
was white and naked like her. He was a fire
to which she fed herself. The moment came
when there was no longer any Rita. A little
ember lay burning happily in his passion.</p>

<p>When he fell asleep she went away. In her
own bed she lay dreaming words that were like
hiding places. Only he could lure her out of
them. After he fell asleep she carried memories
of him into herself&hellip;. He had smiled.
His body had shivered. His fingers had clutched
at her face. He had picked her up and fought
with her. When he did this it was as if he lifted
her to his eyes and she could look at him&mdash;as if
the wind lifted the flames about.</p>

<p><a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-eight</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The street was dark. But he would come
soon. He only stayed away till it grew dark.
Now it was his time again. The street and all
the lights would open the door and come into
the room. And she would be waiting, hidden
away. It was exciting to wait. It was the
way he kissed her&mdash;by making her wait and
pretending when he came that there was no
Rita.</p>

<p>The night was like a story that frightened.
As she watched from the window she remembered
the caravan along the roads. Fires and
dark faces and red handkerchiefs. The night
along the roads changed the trees into birds that
flew away. The wagons went to sleep. Everyone
slept but Rita. The horses had dreams and
whispered to themselves.</p>

<p>Along the roads where the caravan stopped
there would be a fire at night to watch. Rita
sat alone looking at the flames. Dreams came
out of the fire and walked away. Then, hours
afterward, they came back when the fire was
low. They stood around the coals and finally
crawled into the ground. Darkness remained.
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">Ninety-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The wagons became ghosts. She grew sad and
wanted to go away with the night like the
dreams that crept back into the dead fire.</p>

<p>Now his eyes were like the hiding places
she had wished. She trembled. He was coming.
She could see him out of the window,
walking slowly in the street below. She closed
her eyes.</p>

<p>The door opened and her heart bowed
itself. Her fingers, stiffened with colored rings,
pressed at her breasts. Now there was a game
to play. He walked up and down pretending
Rita was hidden. He was cold and far away.
His face walked like a dead man back and
forth in the room. Goliath shuffled as fast as
he could and hid himself in the curtains. She
crouched in the chair, her knees drawn up, her
eyes cringing with delight.</p>

<p>She could watch his face. When he was
far away she had further to go to reach him,
and each step was like a kiss she gave him. His
anger, his words, his cold face and his hands
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>striking her were wild roads down which she
ran toward a fire that waited.</p>

<p>He paid no attention but walked up and
down and his eyes ignored her. But he would
begin to talk soon. She would undress for him.
One by one, rings, bands of gold, silks and petticoats&mdash;each
that came off was like a part of her
already burning.</p>

<p>She stood up naked. Only she was left
now. Her body caressed her with its desires.
She must go on undressing. There was something
more to give him. She would remove
something of herself&mdash;her arms, her breasts,
her white thighs. She gave these to him with
her dresses and jewels. They were things for
him to burn up.</p>

<p>He was looking at her because she had
crawled to his feet. This was when he began to
talk to her&mdash;when she placed her arms around
his feet and bent her head to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>He was motionless and far away and tall
above her. He stood like the night. His white
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred One</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>face was the cold moon. She waited and heard
the wind blow against the windows. She waited
for him to grow warm.</p>

<p>His hands lifted her up. He held them
around her neck, his fingers tightening. She
opened her eyes and loved him. He talked to
her. She listened and wished to die in his hands,
if he desired her, if it would make his eyes
smile at her.</p>

<p>But his fingers loosened and he threw her
down. She lay smiling on the floor as he walked
away. He went on talking, louder and louder.
His voice was like a sword swinging. He was
angry. His words were soft and quick.</p>

<p>She looked up only when he laughed. He
was standing against the red curtains laughing.
His finger was pointing to her. He stood
watching her with his eyes screeching like parrots
and laughing as he pointed.</p>

<p>Kneeling, she covered her face with her
hands. His laughter came nearer. His hands
began to strike. Pain leaped to greet them.
Pain, like wings, raised her body to his eyes.
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>His hands were striking and tearing. They
played a game with her body.</p>

<p>Candles lighted in her head. He was
laughing and throwing himself against her.
She felt blood come out of her and cover her
with little flames. But he would let her come
close soon. After he had struck her and become
like a fire she would crawl close to him and he
would let her give herself, what was left of
herself.</p>

<p>His hands knocked her down again and
she lay without moving. He was still laughing
and pulling at her. She kneeled and covered
her face. Her head kept nodding at him.</p>

<p>Now she would die. He would devour her.
Her body fell and rose as if he were swinging
her around his head. His hands drove nails
through her breasts. Her voice ran away from
her and screamed. But she continued to nod
her head and to come toward him out of the
hiding places. His blows were binding her
body with red ropes. But soon she would lie
against him and give herself to his passion.
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>She would feel his body burning from the
blows he had given her. She closed her eyes
and screamed. He grew larger and she was no
longer able to understand the pain&hellip;.</p>

<p>When she awoke Goliath was bending
over her. He was whispering excitedly. Sunlight
made red shadows in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>She slid to the floor and then stood up carefully.
Pain halted her and she moaned. But
her eyes continued to hunt the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>

<p>Goliath watched her and his head rolled
excitedly. She straightened and dragged herself
to the door of his room. It was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mallare,&rdquo; she cried. Her hands beat
against her head, &ldquo;Mallare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Goliath remained watching her naked
figure stumbling through the rooms as she
called the name. She returned to the couch
and threw herself face down. She lay moaning
and tearing the cushions with her fingers.</p>

<p><a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Four</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He had gone away. He had beaten her
not because he loved. He hated her. And he
had taken himself away from her. She understood.
He no longer wanted her. He had
laughed and tried to kill her.</p>

<p>With a scream she rushed into his bedroom
and threw herself against the unused
pillows. Her arms struck at them. She began
to talk aloud in the language she knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone away, gone away,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
am yours and you gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But words were too involved. She beat at
the pillows and screamed. When he came back
she would kill him. While he sat in his chair
writing she would creep close and drive a
knife. That was what would happen to him
because he no longer loved her and because he
had beaten her to say goodbye.</p>

<p>It was day outside. When it grew dark
again he would come back. She would wait,
but not as before. She was no longer his.</p>

<p>In her room Rita bathed herself and
searched for her old clothes. She found them
<a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hidden&mdash;the wide dress with red and yellow
stripes, the many blue and scarlet petticoats
that she had worn when he brought her home
from the caravan; the long black earrings, the
green and orange shawl for her head. She put
these on. They hid the vivid marks on her body.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Dressed in her gypsy clothes she came into
the room again. It would be long to wait. But
darkness would come and then he would open
the door again. She lay down on the couch
and sighed.</p>

<p class="start"><img class="initial" src="images/m.png"
 width="144" height="200" alt="M" /><span class="start">allare</span>, wrapped in a
heavy overcoat, his hands in
thick gloves, walked from
his door into the street. The
cold straightened him. The
deserted night mirrored
itself in a thin coating of
snow that overlay the roof-tops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sleep,&rdquo; he thought. His head bent
toward the wind. &ldquo;The streets are empty. The
night is mine. I must think of what has happened.
There is something inexplicable in
what has happened. My hands fought with a
phantom. That, of course, is nonsense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do I know my hands fought?
Merely because I remember them striking.
<a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Yet that may have been an illusion too! Then
why are my hands tired? Why do my arms
ache? Another illusion, of course. Logic is
independent of truth. Logic is the persuasive
repetition of ideas by which man hypnotizes
himself. I must beware of logic. It will but
tie me hopelessly to hallucination. I must
think without evidence. I do not know anything.
What I see, hear, smell, touch is nothing.
I can no longer summon my senses as witnesses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is that unusual? I must sink to
moralizings in order to understand myself.
What is reality but the habit of illusion. Man
sees the unexpected once and identifies it as
hallucination. He sees it twice and calls it phenomenon.
But if he acquired the habit of seeing
the unexpected, he accepts it as reality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the same manner in which he builds
phantoms into furniture, converts his Gods
into sciences, his myths into laws; in that way
he also reduces his furniture into phantoms. He
converts his emotions into music, his nervous
disorders into literature, his three elemental
<a name="png.135" id="png.135"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>desires into thought. He is continually holding
a mirror to nature and worshipping the
childish phantoms within the mirror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the basis of egoism&mdash;the mania
to change realities into unreality. Because
man is the tool of reality. Of unreality he is
the God. It is this desire to dominate which
inspires him to avoid truths over which he has
no sway and to invent myths. Gods and virtues
over which he may set himself up as creator
and policeman. It is this which causes him to
cloud the simplicities of nature in a maze of
interpretations. It is by his interpretations that
he achieves the illusion of importance. Ignored
by the planets, he invents the myth of mathematics
and reduces the universe to a succession
of fractions and Greek letters on a blackboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, of course, for man the egoist. The
more humorous spectacle is the one in which
man finds himself awed by his own lies. His
Gods, his myths, his phantoms come home to
roost. He stands blinking in a veritable storm
of lies. His yesterday&#8217;s lies, his today&#8217;s lies, his
tomorrow&#8217;s lies&mdash;all his obsolete interpretations,
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Ten</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his canonized interpretations; all his systems,
his philosophies; all his Gods and Phantoms&mdash;these
riot and war around him. Error
endlessly assassinates itself in a futile effort to
escape its immortality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the midst of this horrendous confusion,
stands man&mdash;naive and powerless. But
he has his sanity. He blows it up carefully like
a soap bubble and strikes a defiant posture in
its center. And against the walls of his bubble,
his phantoms storm in vain. Within his bubble
he proceeds calmly to assert himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was snowing. The night, white with
snow, stared like a blind man. A phantom
world hung in the air. Houses and street withdrew
silently. The snow covered them. Mallare
walked on, staring into the heavy weave
of flakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great white leopard prowling silently,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;It snows. The moon has come
down and walks beside me. The wind blows
and the moon gallops away on a white horse.
A gentle annihilation. The night has fallen
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Eleven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>asleep and this is a dream that pirouettes in its
head. The street becomes a bridal couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the snow is like my madness. It
snows, snows. I climb silently among soft
branches and white leaves. Delirium sleeps
with a finger to its pale lips. I must continue
to think. The storm hangs like a forgotten sorrow
in my heart. But my thought persists. It
crawls like a little wind through the forgotten
storm. It rides carefully from flake to flake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I overtake myself. What a quaint imbecile
I am. Or rather, was. In my effort to
emancipate myself from life, I succeeded only
in handing myself over to my senses. And my
senses, I perceive, belong not to me but to the
procreative principles of biology. They have
been loaned to me by a master chemist. When
I die my cherished soul will disintegrate into
nothing. It will become a useless thing. It will
unquestionably go to a Heaven which is as non-existent
as itself. Heaven is the emptiness into
which souls vanish. Very good. But my senses,
these are immortal. They will, in some inexplicable
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twelve</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>way, I am certain, continue their idiot
career.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must consider them. I have learned
one thing. They are indifferent to reality and
unreality. They contain life within themselves.
All that exists outside them is extraneous&mdash;shadows
among which they divert themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hallucination that overpowered me
but never seduced my intelligence became a
reality to them. She was a shadow with which
my senses diverted themselves. Then why do
I look upon the business as illogical? The
illogical thing is not that I feel tired from striking
her who had no tangible existence, but that
I should be able to reason beyond the reach of
my senses. Yes, that I should succeed in wresting
them from their prey. For the shadows
with which the senses divert themselves are
tyrants they may never hope to abandon. Man
is at the mercy of his phantoms. Behold, I
arrive at a conclusion which means I am bored
with the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer the snow. But there is time for
the snow. I must establish premises. Climb
<a name="png.139" id="png.139"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>out of the abyss on a ladder of premises. What
did I say about logic? Oh, yes, the persuasive
repetition. One flake remains invisible. A
thousand flakes are of no account. It is only
when the flakes repeat themselves too endlessly
for my eye to distinguish that I finally ignore
them and walk contentedly in a storm. Thus
with logic. When I have surrounded myself
with an infinity of assurances, my error vanishes
in the constant repetition of itself. And
I am reassured. And sane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet I must think simply. The snow
seduces me into fellow labyrinths. I&#8217;ve
destroyed her. My senses were in love with
her. They responded to her kisses. She was a
Thought able to ravish my body. This is what
the pathologists would identify as a triumph
of the psychic sex center. What charming palaverers&mdash;the
pathologists! Man crawls in a
circle around himself and fancies himself an
invader&mdash;a pathologist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A matter of no interest. What I have
done, as the Christian Scientists ably put it, is
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fourteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to rid myself of this Thought. But why was it
necessary to strike at it with my hands, to tear
it with my fingers? This worries me. But did
I do these things? I must convince myself that
I didn&#8217;t. I remember sinking my hands into
her body, pulling at her flesh. I remember
blows given. She screamed. I struck her and
flung her down. These things I recall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they do not interfere with my convictions.
For of what are they proof? The
blows I gave were no more than a shrewd
make-believe. To my senses she was real, and
it was necessary therefore to destroy her realistically.
It was easy for my mind to ignore this
Thought. I was never its victim. I merely
created it. My senses that belong to life and
not to me, however, became victimized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not recall myself as a spectator of
the struggle. I remember it now as I might
remember participating in an honest fight. A
very clever ruse. It is evident I loaned myself.
I surrendered adroitly to my idiotic senses.
Therefore for that hour I was completely mad.
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>What happened in the room? Ah, what a
grotesque memory it makes. Mallare knocking
his fists against the air. Mallare throwing
himself around like an epileptic. Sinking his
fingers into nothing&mdash;a shadow boxer pummelling
frenziedly at space. That was madness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it served its purpose. For I&#8217;ve
destroyed her. Rita, Rita is gone. Yet there&#8217;s
a curious twist in that. I am lacking one
memory. One very important memory hides
from me. I calculate its time and place, but,
like a recalcitrant comet, it fails to enter the
appointed void. Alas, I no longer remember
killing her in the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am certain I did. Why, certain?
Because my logic establishes the fact. Still, I
would feel better about something, if my memory
were more docile. But what is memory?
The soul of dead illusion. Since it withholds
itself, I will create a memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a lamp shining over my head.
I was walking. And then I stood still. Oh, yes,
shadows. I grew eloquent with shadows. And
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>she appeared in the midst of this eloquence.
My hands choked her. She had followed me
into the street and I choked her. But I do not
remember this. At least, the thing grows elusive
and unsatisfactory. Why? Ah, the snow
covers me. I will cover my confusion with a
sigh like the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I see the thing now. Was she ever
real? There were gypsy wagons and an old
man. A camp fire and this girl with the green
and orange shawl. Yes, these were realities.
But how do I know? Hm, I place my finger
on the sore spot. There is a point where reality
and unreality meet. And this point has vanished
from my mind. I pursue it. A matter of
remarkable importance. It evades me; therefore
I will arbitrarily locate it. The point
between reality and unreality is the arc lamp
in the street. Up to that point Rita was real. I
killed her at that point and she became unreal.
This statement cures me. Nevertheless, my
sanity is a myth. I have invented it, by arbitrarily
identifying the moment of its departure.
But it is better that way than to blunder on
<a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Seventeen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>without knowing how mad I am or whether I
am mad at all, or whether I ever have been
mad. A lie believed in is an antidote for
confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&#8217;t matter. Excellent logic. She
is destroyed. And I am none the worse, except
for a disillusion more&mdash;and an uncertainty.
My uncertainty is removed by logic, or at least
concealed by it. And I am sane. I return to
life&mdash;another Napoleon walking backwards.
My experiments have led me around a circle.
I meet myself where I started, but naked of
hopes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It snows and I am amiable. Something
has happened. My hatred, where is that? This
street is pleasant. The light of the snow cheers
me. I am, in fact, buoyant. Ah, I understand.
A balloon come down to earth and vain once
more of its buoyancy&mdash;its ability to bob along
the pavement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious. I delude myself that I am
thinking. But my alleged thoughts do not
further my ideas. They merely convert them
<a name="png.144" id="png.144"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Eighteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>into little pictures easy for me to understand
and diverting to look at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, if I am happy &hellip; but how does
one know one is happy? I suspect my happiness.
It is a clown&#8217;s suit in which my mourning
disguises itself. Mallare has fallen out of his
black heaven. And he picks himself up like a
good burgher. He grunts and chuckles and
looks at the skies, alas, without curiosity. Lucifer,
fallen, finds diversion as a janitor in red
tights. Ergo, I have proved something. I am
in Hell and with Lucifer I know its secret&mdash;happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mallare who fancied himself a
madman? Who sought to climb over his senses
and found himself impaled by a tower of Babel?
Where are his angers, his disgusts that were the
noble shadows thrown by his egoism to blot out
a world? Ballad of rhetorical questions. My
vanity preens itself with <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'reminiscenses'">reminiscences</ins>. I smile.
I am depressed and content. Answers whisper.
Mallare is on his feet. His experiments are
ended. His mania to possess himself is a snow
<a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Nineteen</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that falls forgotten in his past. Vale, the lunatic.
Vale, the man in the moon. Ave, Mallare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It snows. I walk. I think. I smile. And
this too for a time is a diversion&mdash;that people
no longer distract me. I carelessly restore the
world. Let there be people, I say. And, alas,
there are. I abdicate. I hand my Godhood
back to the race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning begins like another snow in the
distance. Ah, here comes one tired-eyed out of
a house. It is astounding to think that he is
human like myself. He and I are actors in the
same play, yet ignorant of each other&#8217;s lines.
But I may guess at his part. He is frightened.
He looks furtively toward me. And he walks
rather lamely. Aha, a fornicator! He has left
a warm bed, illegally occupied for the night.
A woman in a rumpled night dress moaned
under him. The plot is simple. How pleasing
it was for a moment. She came so close. She
was like an incredibly intimate secret. He
gasped physiological instructions. And&mdash;finis!
The captains and the kings depart. The recessional
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of the douche! Do you love me yet, do
you love me yet?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now he walks in the cold street. He
must hurry away. There are complications,
but they make a minor drama. Off stage business.
He is aware of contrasts. A moment
ago&mdash;her arms, her gasps. A moment ago
warmth, intimacy. And now, the snow, the
cold, and life. Memory like fool&#8217;s gold jingles
in his pocket. Life is real, life is earnest. He
regrets his orgasms. They will interfere with
business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The male rampant! What a sinister
comedian! The mythical despoiler. Hm, his
head bows down. The snow disturbs him. Sad,
weary, remorseful, he drags himself home. He
has lessened his virility and it worries him.
There is a plot in this. Some day I will write
it out&mdash;a love story of the sexes. Poor, weary
one, he has enriched Delilah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I am amused. It will be pleasant
to observe people once more. Sanity has its
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>rewards. Its laughter is a charming hint of
madness that one may enjoy harmlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lecherous spectacle a row of dark
houses is! Bedrooms filled with bodies&mdash;incredible
nudities. Bed springs creaking. The
hour of asterisks. Window blinds down. Doors
locked. Lights out. The city lingers in the
snow like a feeble burlesque. Houses and
shops and street car tracks gesture reprovingly.
Civilization bows its head in the night like an
abandoned bride. Man, like an ape hunting
fleas, preoccupies himself again with his nerve
centers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Darkened houses, silence&mdash;Rabelais and
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Boccacio'">Boccaccio</ins> debate the immaculate conception.
Eros, patron saint of the laundryman, conducts
ancient rituals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, these indefatigable and unctuous
fornicators, rolling their eyes piously between
orgasms; embroidering noble mottoes on their
pleasure towels! [These prim exquisites, carefully
and with raised eyebrows, folding their
toilet paper into proper squares!] Who can be
<a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>angry with them? God drove them out of
Paradise&mdash;punishment enough. They revenge
themselves with a monotonous enthusiasm. Ah,
these fellatian moralists! It is folly to take
their <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'hypocricies'">hypocrisies</ins> to heart. The plot is too delicious
for tears. These two-fisted citizens, these
purity braggarts masturbating with one finger
unemployed and pointing scornfully at their
neighbors!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charming street. It offers consolations,
simple ones, to be sure. But nevertheless, consolations.
My madness was not as mad as this
dark street. This is a prettier witches&#8217; night
than the one I aspired to. I am amused and
my amusement is an insult that inspires me. If
one cannot become God, one can at least sit and
sneer happily at the handiwork of his rival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dawn comes into my head. Poor
Mallare, who must readjust his vocabulary to
coherences. The night flies away. How simple
this little scene becomes. Mysteries vanish.
Doors open. Window blinds raise themselves.
And now people stick their heads out into the
<a name="png.149" id="png.149"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>cold. Wagons, trucks, crowds begin. They
hurry to work, older by a night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sanity laughs at them, but sadly. I
detect an obligato to my mirth. The comedy
is poignant only because I am a part of it.
These hurrying ones with their tired faces and
eager shoulders are my brothers and sisters
sharing with me the spectacle they make. They
are a disillusioning mirror in which I see
myself a million times. Yes, they look back at
me, and their weariness, their hopelessness saddens
me. Man sees himself by gazing into the
world&mdash;and is overcome. It is only a lunatic
who can keep merry in the face of so monstrous
an image.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My happiness is without merriment. I
return quickly. I have already the habit of
coherence. In a few hours I will go back again
and begin with canvas and paint once more.
My madness is a lost argument. I am a little
tired. But, alas, he who has danced and slept
with Medusa goes home weary.</p>

<p><a name="png.150" id="png.150"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-four</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;It will take time before my amusement
ripens into rages. And without rages work is
impossible. I will wait. Now I am too indifferent
for anything but happiness. It is easy
to walk and forget one&#8217;s self and one&#8217;s senses.
It will come back. Mallare will return and
expend himself naively in decorations once
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I am strong again I will hunt up a
woman. Poor Rita, whom I have murdered
twice, illustrating the paradox of possession.
Man, the slave of his senses, possesses only
what his five masters offer him as gifts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find a clever one this time whom
jests do not frighten. One who does not burn
incense before her vagina and cover it with an
altar piece. How unctuously women embrace
ideas which increase the value and importance
of their urinal ducts! Modesty, morality, prurience,
piety, are the effulgent underwear
behind which they increase the mystery and
charm of the mons veneris. Alas, they are the
artists of sex and not men. Man has even
<a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>thrown away the seductive cod-piece. The
origins of ideas are varied and multiple. But
whatever their origins, it is women who utilize
them. What an incredible sex! Vaginomaniacs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will hunt up a vulgar woman, one who
does not piously regard her vulva as an orifice
to be approached with Gregorian chants. I
must be careful to avoid those veteran masturbators
marching heroically under the gonfalons
of virginity. It is a difficult business,
finding a woman. A modest one will offend
my intellect. A shameless one will harass my
virility. A stupid one will be unable to appreciate
my largess. An intelligent one will penetrate
my impotency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why women? The devil take them
all. I am almost tired of the disillusions they
have to offer. The homely ones go away grateful
for something they never received. The
pretty ones go away chuckling secretly over
something they never gave. It is a confused
and unintelligible waste of time. It will be
enough to paint, to talk, to sip tea, to wander
<a name="png.152" id="png.152"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>about proselyting in behalf of improvised
Gods. I will divert myself, making love to
women out of range of their bedrooms. I will
engage them conversationally and ravish them
with erect and quivering adjectives. It is not
necessary to undress a woman to know her. She
reveals herself almost as piquantly in moods.
I will be the father of moods. And, as a recreation,
I will sit and watch the days in their
unchanging flight. I bristle with rhetoric. It
is a symptom of sanity. I am grateful for this
ability to bore myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was morning. Mallare paused against
a window. He stood, staring into the life of
the street. His eyes were drawn and the corners
of his wide, thin mouth smiled feebly.</p>

<p>Snow was falling. The morning dissolved
itself. Traffic drifted busily and without sound
behind the snow&mdash;an excited pantomime that
filled the air with misplaced, ventriloquial
whispers.</p>

<p>Mallare remained smiling into the gentle
storm. Snow covered his head and shoulder.</p>

<p><a name="png.153" id="png.153"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;The snow falls,&rdquo; he thought tiredly. &ldquo;It
snows, snows. White flakes lose themselves and
are grateful for the earth. An invisible ending
that flatters them. Well, I have walked all
night and rid myself of wisdoms. I am hungry.
It&#8217;s possible I haven&#8217;t eaten for months. In
order to eat, however, I need money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slipped one of the gloves from his hand
and felt in his pocket. A satisfied smile came
to his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Or I would
have celebrated my sanity by starving to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Withdrawing his hand from his pocket, he
found himself regarding it. It grinned back at
him like a stranger. It was red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; he murmured. His eyes glanced
quickly around and he replaced the glove. He
continued to walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blood,&rdquo; he repeated to himself. The
word made an ending in his thought. He
walked slowly staring at it. His silence lifted.
A voice crept into him and began to speak
from a distance.</p>

<p><a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-eight</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; it murmured. &ldquo;Be cautious.
Remember you were mad. You had almost
forgotten. There is something to think about,
now. You will walk slowly and think. It&#8217;s
not as easy as it seemed. Be careful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your fists fought with a phantom. Blows,
wild blows. The grotesque memory&mdash;the madman
pummelling the air. That was you. And
your hands are bruised. They&#8217;ve been bleeding.
Her breasts and head were something
else. Your fists struck mercilessly at chairs and
walls. When your hands are washed you will
find bruises over them that have been bleeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on nodding his head slowly.
Later he stopped. The snow was piling itself
over the grass of a small park. The swollen
shapes of trees and benches rested in the storm.</p>

<p>Mallare sat down on a bench and removed
his gloves. Both hands were red. Smiling
tiredly, he began to rub them with the snow.
His eyes waited as the color dissolved. His
hands were clean. He looked at them and
nodded.</p>

<p><a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Twenty-nine</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;There are no bruises,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;The blood came from something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused and watched the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious,&rdquo; he whispered aloud. &ldquo;Then
I am still mad. Careful &hellip; mad. For there
was blood &hellip; and not mine. So it would seem
I have been seducing myself with optimisms. A
true madman. Yes, a lunatic mumbling excitedly
to himself in the snow all night, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sane. Mallare is quite sane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I&#8217;m too clever for you, Mallare.
Very much too clever. You present a pair of
red hands to me. I wash them carefully in
the snow. They become white. Interesting
phenomena.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He chuckled softly and stared at the snow
and swollen trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old circle again,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;And I begin the absorbing hide and go seek
with my senses. Who am I and where do I
end? And who are they and where do they
<a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>begin? Let us study the phenomenon of red
hands. Primo&mdash;how do I know there was
blood? My eyes said, &lsquo;blood.&rsquo; And the snow
is red. But that is only because my eyes, infatuated
with an idea, repeat the information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I, Mallare, who am no madman&#8217;s
pawn, no lickspittle secretary to my senses, I
say, &lsquo;no blood.&rsquo; I am the Pope. I excommunicate
the phenomenon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, if there is blood, I fought with one
who could bleed. And even my cleverness
could not supply arteries in a phantom. Ergo,
there is no blood. I am still mad. I see that
which is not. But it is nothing to be disturbed
about. In fact, it is a diversion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The snow slowly covered the figure of
Mallare. His drawn eyes balanced themselves
amid the flakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It snows, snows,&rdquo; he murmured after a
pause. &ldquo;And I remember something. What is
it I think! Rita &hellip; Yes, there would be
blood if Rita were &hellip; Hm, the murdered
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>one. There was something I didn&#8217;t remember
while I walked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t. Not that way. Careful, Mallare.
Be careful. There are thoughts impossible to
think. Yes, impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again silence filled him. His drawn eyes
widened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mallare,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you are a madman.
I know. This chokes. Yes. It was I&mdash;I,
Mallare. It is I who have been mad. I have
been mad myself. Not you. No, not you! But
the God&mdash;the Strange Pose. I can&#8217;t. An impossible
denouement. My head breaks. Her
blood &hellip; Rita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared open mouthed at a question that
circled toward him out of the snow. Words
babbled in his head. He shook himself away
from them and stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was alive!&rdquo; he cried aloud. &ldquo;My
phantom lived. It was I who was the phantom.
And she&mdash;alive!&rdquo;</p>

and gleaming with terror. Then the
figure of Mallare fell forward and lay curved
in the snow.</p>

<p class="top2">&ldquo;I am the one who contemplates.
I am the Knowing
One. There is nothing I
do not know. It is amazing
to be Mallare. I have triumphed
over five worlds. I
look down upon a rabble of Mallares. There
are five Mallares&mdash;five sullen looking madmen.
One of them sits and listens to voices.
Another of them wanders about, staring with
sad eyes at intolerable visions. Another of
them lies on his back, babbling excitedly with
the darkness. Another of them eats and sleeps
<a name="png.164" id="png.164"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>like a prosperous grocer. And there is a fifth
Mallare who weeps. A baffling rogue who
puts his arms around me and blubbers on my
shoulder like a lodge brother. He says nothing,
and of them all I dislike him the most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His silence is mysterious. His tears are
uncomfortable. A distressing ass, weeping,
blubbering. He implores me. Aha, I have it.
I know his secret. He is memory&mdash;a memory
of myself following me around like a heart-broken
mother a wayward son.</p>

<p><ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original omits opening double quote">&ldquo;Five</ins> Mallares, five sinister comedians to
entertain me. And I, what can I call myself&mdash;pure
reason? No, a disgusting title. Rather,
Unreason, since I am after all the Indifferent
One. But all this is a quibble inspired by modesty.
I am God. I am that which men have
worshipped&mdash;the aloof one, the pitiless and
amused one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The five tribes of Mallare rage and curse
beneath me, fill the air with profanations, weep
and gibber in the night. But I sit inviolate and
wait for them&mdash;even for that blubbering one
<a name="png.165" id="png.165"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>whose tongue is thick with tears and whose
idiot eyes implore me&mdash;and they return. They
raise their faces to me, their God, and fall prostrate
before my smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the weeping one who causes me
the most trouble. A reluctant worshipper who
annoys me. He clings like another phantom.
A meddlesome imbecile who keeps buttonholing
me and pouring out tales of woe. And who
keeps my name on his lips. I can see it moving
on his lips. But he is dumb. I have his secret
though. This dumb one came to me in the
snow. I was faint. Hunger had thrown me to
the ground. When I stood up he was beside
me. His lips moved excitedly but they made
no sound. And we walked home together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is this pathetic intruder?&rsquo; I thought.
&lsquo;He walks beside me gesturing with his lips
and weeping, weeping. He falls on my neck
and embraces me. His eyes roll with panic.
What new variant of madness is this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is curious that of all the Mallares he
alone is speechless. The others keep up their
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:

<a name="png.166" id="png.166"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of Bedlam. But this dumb one who
attached himself to me in the snow, even his
lips have stopped moving now, except to form
my name slowly as he blubbers on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am kind to him and forgiving. I smile.
I even coax him to speak, to move his lips once
more. In the snow when he followed me home
I was able to detect words his silence spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blood on your hands,&rsquo; he repeated.
&lsquo;Think, think, Mallare.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I humored him and looked at my hands.
They were clean. And I answered him soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are an interesting quirk,&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;My senses that fancy they have killed a woman
have given birth to an illusion of guilt. And
you are that illusion. My madness dresses itself
in logic like a fishwife hanging rhinestones in
her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be calm,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Mallare has slain only
a phantom, and the murder of illusions is a
highly respectable privilege whose exercise is
rewarded on earth as well as in heaven.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.167" id="png.167"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;But this creature was not to be diverted
from himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is another one of them,&rsquo; I thought.
&lsquo;He walks and implores and wrings his hand
and babbles, &lsquo;blood, blood that was real.&rsquo; And
there is nothing to be done with him. Another
pathologic symptom asks the hospitality of
Mallare, and I must make the proper pretense
of graciousness and cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But first I must identify my guest. Take
his measure out of the corner of my eye and
understand him. Very well, I have been the
victim of a hallucination which my senses
accepted as real. And which I was able to
murder only by pretending I too believed it
real. Therefore, having committed this illusory
crime, there results this illusory sense of
guilt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thus we walked home, this dumb
one and I, his absurd grief confusing me. I
will confess. My name on his lips frightened
me at first. As it sometimes does now. For he
has become more than an illusion of guilt. He
<a name="png.168" id="png.168"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>is, this sly fellow, a memory, inarticulate and
envious. He envies me because I am clever
enough to laugh at my madness. However, I
will consider him later, in his various guises,
for of all the Mallares, dumb though he is and
ludicrous with inane tears, he interests me the
most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We walked home and I finally fell to
belaboring him. A pest, a mendicant, a croaking
idiot&mdash;I cursed him out roundly and
refused him further attention. This is the
wisest course sometimes. It is dangerous to
humor too carelessly these sprawling Mallares.
They are slyly at war with my omnipotence.
I can understand the anger of God. Sacrilege
confuses Him. And We are all alike&mdash;We
Gods. We are forced into an attitude of indifference
in order that We may keep Ourselves
intact. Thus We look down with Consummate
dispassion upon Our hallucinations&mdash;Our
worlds. And it is this dispassion that men worship
in Us, unable to understand Our lack of
interest and terrified by Our aloofness they
prostrate themselves before an infinite mystery.</p>

<p><a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Thirty-nine</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Yet, though the theology of God has
become the secret of My unreason, I find
Myself dangerously susceptible. It is when I
seek to appease My loneliness by raising one of
the babbling ones to My side. He enters My
black heaven with a pretense of gratitude,
fawning before Me and accepting My fellowship
with humility. There follows then a
moment of insidious diversion. Slowly a confusion
fills Me. Yes, even I am open to confusion.
It is a pity I have for the babbling one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I listen to his complaints. The sad-eyed
Mallare staring at intolerable visions. Mallare,
the dark chatterer. Or this other one&mdash;My
friend the weeping lodge brother. Yes, I
pity them and soothe them. But I find Myself
singularly moved. Their prayers move Me.
They begin to whisper that I return with them.
I am tempted to follow them, to let them take
My hand and lead Me into their strange houses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I smile in time and My smile, fixed
and profound, overcomes them. They prostrate
themselves once more before the mystery
<a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of My indifference. And I remain the God of
Mallare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On this day the dumb one sprawled along
home with me, there were many curious things
happened. I had walked all night in the snow
weary with hunger. Rita, who had driven me
into a moment of fury&mdash;I had destroyed her
for the time. A strange destruction during
which I pummelled the air like a veritable
madman. But the ruse had served to rid me of
the hallucination for the night. Finally, tired
with walking and hunger, I fell from a bench
in the park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I awoke I recalled at once the grotesque
struggle of the night. And with this
dumb, weeping creature dogging my steps, I
returned home. She was still with me. I
smiled, although I confess there was despair in
my thought. For I had fancied the miserable
business of the night had put an end to the
hallucination. No, she was still there. She was
waiting for me on the couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my mind had not deceived itself. It
was as I had thought. I had planned to rid
<a name="png.171" id="png.171"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>myself of her by hating this phantom until my
hate had darkened it. Then there would be
nothing but an imperceptible shadow of her
remaining, one with which my senses could no
longer seduce themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I came into the room I saw
my plot was working. For her eyes no longer
gleamed. A radiance had left her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My hate begins to operate upon this
chimera,&rsquo; I thought. I frowned at her and sat
down, worn out with the walking of the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have undermined the infatuation of
this phantom,&rsquo; I thought. I would have been
elate but it occurred to me there was an inconsistency.
This dumb one, this sniveling one, persisted.
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original omits opening single quote">&lsquo;And</ins> how should he, who was dependent
upon her death for his existence, persist in her
presence?&rsquo; This was a question for Mallare,
the indifferent one. This was a query to answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I will write more about this blubberer,
for the answer to him is piquantly
involved. It is like a head with too many hats.
<a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>But not now&mdash;I will not write about him now.
I will only bear him in mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She watched me from the couch and I
became aware of something. I studied her
cautiously. Her eyes no longer gleamed with
love. There was a radiance absent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aha,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;she hates. Mallare
recovers the strings to his Frankenstein. His
puppet dances again to his will. See, my senses
no longer leap to her. They tremble warily
before the hate in her eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched her as she watched me. And
then an incredible thing happened. She arose
from the couch and came slowly toward me
and she held a knife in her hand. She came
toward me with the knife at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Clever,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;In fact, a miracle
of cleverness. This phantom has gone mad. It
is madder than I. It fancies itself able to slay
me. It advances upon me with its dagger of
mist and it intends to fall upon me. This mysterious
logic that grows of itself like a fungus
in darkness, where will it end? Already it
<a name="png.173" id="png.173"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>towers around me&mdash;a monstrous weed rising
out of my madness, and I am chilled by its
shadow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I continued to think:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I desired to be rid of her. My desire
finally overleaped my befuddled senses. And
now this desire has become a new soul for my
phantom. Yet I planned no details in my desire.
I did not will this melodramatic denouement.
Then it is obvious that my desire is like a seed
filled with hidden life. I blow a thought into
my phantom and that thought develops and
hatches. This is a phenomenon to be written
about.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I thought she came closer and finally
stood over me. Her eyes, I observed, were completely
mad. Yes, they were like horrible fires.
And her face was a marvel of mimicry. The
cleverness of my thought appalled me. I said
nothing, however, and watched her. She began
to talk. I had become used to this phase of the
hallucination. But this time my senses shuddered
at her words. They who had been so
<a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>eager to sate themselves in the possession of
this chimera and who had betrayed my omnipotence,
they now suffered the penalty of their
blindness. For it was evident that to them, this
chimera was still real. She was an avenger
towering with a knife above them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mallare smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See,&rsquo; he murmured aloud, &lsquo;here is the
reward of your folly. You would philander
with this shadow. You would disport yourself
in abominable fornications with this hallucination.
Very well, I am amused at your clownish
terror even more than I was amused at your
burlesque ecstasies. Tremble now for here is
a Medusa, a <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Messilina'">Messalina</ins> come to destroy you.
Whimper and grovel, but observe in your idiot
cowardice how Mallare, the indifferent one,
sits and smiles&mdash;still supreme, still a spectator
ravished by the dark comedy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not resist this moment of triumph.
I laughed although there was no one to enjoy
my laughter. And I watched her. She was still
talking, deep, meaningless words. For it was
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her habit to talk in the gypsy language when
moved. Often this fact baffled me. But I perceive
now that my thought was a seed containing
my omniscience in microcosm. God does
not invent languages but He understands them
since it is unnecessary for Him to know, in His
indifference, what they are saying. And the
language my phantom spoke, although foreign
to me, was nevertheless an integral part of my
thought&mdash;another of the manifestations with
which God naively astounds Himself. It is
His only diversion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was curious concerning the effect upon
my senses of this illusory attack. And, I must
confess these things simply, there came to me
the idea that Mallare might be slain by the
cowardice of his senses. There would be nothing
illogical in that. For if this chimera had
been able to trick them into the illusion of love,
it was entirely natural that it should be able to
trick them now into the illusion of death. With
the exception that death is an illusion even
Mallare, the indifferent one, might not survive.</p>

<p><a name="png.176" id="png.176"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-six</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Ah, Mallare, Mallare! He wanders pensively
amid treacherous shadows&mdash;Mallare&mdash;an
image debating subtly the existence of its
mirror. I sigh. But it is one of the relaxations
of God&mdash;to pity Himself His uselessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her talk came to an end and she raised
her knife. Die or not, the thing was too incredible
a farce to leave me unmoved. Yes, I
laughed out of sheer delight. The drollery of
this phantom hacking at Mallare with a non-existent
dagger &hellip; a mad windmill charging
Don Quixote! Superb!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive now a moral in the situation
that I did not think of at the time. Sacrilege is
a vital danger to God. His omnipotence is
dependent upon the submission of His creatures.
And they who, inspired with the quaint
illusion of their own reality, turn upon Him&mdash;ah,
they destroy themselves. But their destruction
impoverishes their God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time, however, the spectacle alone
and not its significances, preoccupied me. I
laughed and reached my hand to the dagger.
A sadistic gesture, for I desired to give my
<a name="png.177" id="png.177"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>senses a taste of its reality and thus enjoy their
squirming. Marvelous dagger! The point of it
was sharp. Mallare can invent daggers, beautiful
daggers that poise melodramatically over
his heart, that move slowly in quest of his life&#8217;s
blood! S&#8217;death, a property man of parts!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Clever dagger,&rsquo; I murmured. &lsquo;Do you
enjoy the illusion of yourself as much as this
chimera wielding you quivers with the illusion
of impending murder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It paused before me and I nodded. My
laughter had halted it. It was evident that my
thought operating in this phantom was confused
by my laughter. I nodded again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It would be logical and extremely pleasant,&rsquo;
I thought, &lsquo;if this creature, shrinking
before the sacrilege of destroying its creator,
turned on itself and accomplished a more probable
assassination.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She stood before me and I was pleased to
see her hatred increase. It was amazingly
vivid. I observed the viciousness of her features.
Her face had become contorted. Its fury
<a name="png.178" id="png.178"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>was like a mask. But she had dropped the knife.
I could not refrain smiling an encouragement
at her&mdash;the naive applause an author bestows
upon his puppets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the plot still contained surprises. <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original lacks comma">Yes,</ins>
astonishing denouements began to crowd the
stage. For she started to undress. Here was
a trick that baffled Mallare. I winced with
distaste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The consistency which I have hitherto
admired in my madness seems rather dubious.&rsquo;
I thought. &lsquo;The melodrama of illusions grows
too improbable. This fine tragedy crumbles
into the ludicrous. She forgets her hate. She
is again Rita, the infatuated one. A lightning
change that smacks of inferior vaudeville. She
is about to undress and resume her deplorable
assaults upon my idiot senses. A poorly written
business. I have a notion to walk out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I remained smiling at the absurdity,
too tired to leave my chair. I was pleased
to notice that her nudity did not this time
appeal to my doting madness. This marked an
<a name="png.179" id="png.179"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Forty-nine</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>improvement&mdash;a foretaste of victory. The disintegration
had begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her body was interesting. It was covered
with bruises. There were stains on its flesh.
At the sight of them the lodge brother, the
sniveling one who had followed me home in
the snow, set up a veritable caterwauling. Here
was terrible evidence of the fellow&#8217;s guilt. The
bruises of course. An accomplished penitent,
this blubberer, able to transform himself from
a Sense of Homicidal Guilt into a mere feeling
of General Remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was not dead. Yet he lingered. And
now, at the sight of her bruises, he rushed
forward with inferior regrets. He will bear
study, this weeping one. Of all the sprawling
Mallares, he alone lacks logic. But I will come
to him later. The plot is more entertaining than
this incongruous spectator weeping and hissing
out of turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She began to talk once more and wildly.
The sense of it dawned on me. She was calling
Goliath. He came shuffling from his usual
<a name="png.180" id="png.180"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hiding place&mdash;the curtains. A diverting little
monster. I bear him no ill will. Although I
grow slightly envious of his madness. Yet his
madness is a terrific flattery. It is involved and
piquant and one of the things that remain for
me to study cautiously. The madness of Goliath
and, of course, this gentleman Niobe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came out, a fact at the time that astonished
me. For I had not been aware of his
madness. He stood with his bent and bulbous
body shaking and his hands resting like a baboon&#8217;s
on the floor. I was noticing the excitement
of his huge head when it came to me with
a curious feeling&mdash;he was looking at her. Yes,
Goliath my servant was looking not at me. But
at her!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Careful, Mallare, be careful,&rsquo; I thought.
The insane sniveling of this lodge brother distracted
me. His arms came around me and he
rested his head on me and wept. Insufferable
ass! It was impossible to think. I remained
with my eyes watching and repeating cautiously
to myself the warning.</p>

<p><a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-one</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Here was a trick too baffling for Mallare.
Mallare must suspend himself, close his eyes
and climb slowly back into his black heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then Goliath too is a phantom,&rsquo; I
thought. &lsquo;But careful, be careful, Mallare.
That is too easy. And you remember. It is
dangerous to hide from too many memories.
They will become shadows that nibble at
you. He is not a phantom. Goliath is no
chimera. He lives. He has reality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then how does it come,&rsquo; I continued
thinking, &lsquo;that he sees that which is visible only
to you? His eyes are fastened on her who is to
be seen only inside the caverns of Mallare. He
raises his arms. His hands touch her. I am
imagining Goliath. Goliath is not in the room.
This is a memory of him that has wandered
onto the scene of my madness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here my thinking ended. I sat contemplating
the imbecile, the blubberer. He pressed
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'himslf'">himself</ins> upon me with his shameless importunings.
He snivelled and his lips moved with
my name. I watched them say, &lsquo;Mallare&rsquo; and
<a name="png.182" id="png.182"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>repeat &lsquo;Mallare&rsquo; till I grew dizzy with the
pantomime of my name. I will study this later
and discover the secret of his lips. My name
drifting continually over them has a way of
hypnotizing me. But later&mdash;later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I began thinking once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This lodge brother weeps while Goliath
takes liberties with my phantom. There is a
connection there. But it is unimportant for the
present. I must discover something else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, like a victory too long withheld, it
came to me. He was mad. Goliath, my servant,
was mad. But more than that&mdash;a telepathic
madness. I have elaborated my understanding
since. Goliath suffers from a contagion. His
constant attendance upon me has proved fatal
to his stupidity. His senses are the victims of
my puppets. He has entered my world and my
madness creates for him, as it does for me,
shadows that deceive him. But there is no
Mallare in him. Unlike me, he does not sit in
amused judgment upon himself.</p>

<p><a name="png.183" id="png.183"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-three</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;It is an interesting phenomenon&mdash;this
strange mesmerism. It remains to be studied.
Goliath and I are mad brothers. This understanding
arrived in time. Or else I would have
flung myself in despair upon the ever-imploring
bosom of my lugubrious sniveler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rita was real to Goliath. I watched him
excitedly and continued to think. I addressed
myself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Observe,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;here you have a distressing
visualization. Goliath, your dwarf,
mimics your madness. And it is not pleasant
to look at. His eyes roll with passion. His fat
lips chew upon lewd expectations. His fingers
raise themselves like frightened blasphemies to
her breasts. And he watches you. Yes, his eyes
sneak glimpses of you. For you are his rival!
You and this nigger monster are vaginal comrades.
It is pleasant to see that you have the
decency to feel <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original omits closing single quote">enraged.&rsquo;</ins> Five infatuated Mallares
sputtered and wept and gnashed their
teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I talked I turned my attention to her.
In my excitement over Goliath I had ignored
<a name="png.184" id="png.184"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her. Her hands were fumbling with the clothes
of this doting rival. But her eyes were on me.
They blazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This pantomime of shadows grows
involved,&rsquo; I thought. But I was experimenting
with rhetoric. For the thing was absurdly simple.
Hate still animated my phantom. And
this was her revenge. She was about to give
herself to the black dwarf Goliath. She was
about to commit sexual hari-kari.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched her hands remove his clothes,
his red jacket, his fine shirt. He jumped up
and down like a distracted child, his own hands
bewildered with too many activities. They fondled
her, they tugged at his trousers. They
became insane and flapped at his sides. She
helped him, her eyes still watching me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last I produce a horror worthy of
myself,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;The mist dagger was melodrama
to be smiled at. But this&mdash;ah, here we
have a refinement that reduces death to a minor
obscenity. She attacks me now with a weapon
worthy my indifference. It is true, my senses
<a name="png.185" id="png.185"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-five</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>writhe less frightenedly. But I, Mallare&mdash;yes,
Mallare the Supreme One&mdash;honor her assault
with a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, who but Mallare could have invented
so subtle a blasphemy, so accomplished an
enemy. It is an old theological quibble, but I
understand it now. God is the greatest atheist.
He is proud of a disbelief in Himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, this phantom is the atheism of Mallare.
And it is at last a true child. A parental
pride excites me. Like Mallare, her father,
she rises above herself. I have breathed the
soul of hate into her. My hatred alive with a
cleverness of its own speaks to itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It says, &lsquo;I am the hatred of Mallare. I
desire to murder him. I am his phantom, but
the suffering and insult he has heaped upon me
grow unbearable. His cruelty and coldness
have filled me with fury. I would have killed
him but that would have been almost an infidelity.
For his senses have been my lovers. I
remember them with tears. I decided not to
kill him because that would have meant to kill
<a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-six</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his senses. But this other one, this Insufferable
and Aloof One&mdash;this Serene One staring amusedly
at me out of His black heaven&mdash;how send
my hatred against him? Ah, I will conspire
with his senses. I am no more than an idea in
the head of God. But the head of God is but
an idea that encircles me. I am a phantom
within a phantom. Thus I must make myself
nauseous. I must make myself too hideous. I
must make myself so monstrous that the Idea
which contains me will feel an anguish. And
this anguish will be the applause to my hate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat shrewdly silent, for the moment
was approaching. At last I perceived myself
behind the logic of this Frankenstein. For it
was I&mdash;I, Mallare&mdash;that was attacking myself
with this hatred. It was Mallare who was
arranging this little plot for himself. And
why? Because then the head of Mallare, nauseated
by the vileness of the assault, would disgorge
forever the hallucination of Rita. It was
an emetic Mallare had found necessary to
administer to himself.</p>

<p><a name="png.187" id="png.187"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-seven</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;Ah, my cleverness grows incredible. I
am too Supreme to grasp Myself. There are
still unexplored crevices in My infinity, and
out of these continue to issue surprises that
divert Me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goliath was undressed. His black body,
lumped and like some mad caricature of itself,
gleamed in the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Note this bulbous little
black man. For he is a caricature not of himself
but of you. He is a rival before whom
your senses wince as before some unflattering
image. Yes&mdash;the image of Mallare stands
saluting his charming chimera with an interesting
Ethiopian erection. For though they
differ in many externals, Mallare and Goliath
are one. They are ornamented insulations for
an identical current. And here, throbbing
under an erection is the current of Mallare and
of an infinity of Mallares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, the penis of this dwarf is repellent
because that which Mallare so fondly called
his own&mdash;his desires&mdash;is revealed to him as
<a name="png.188" id="png.188"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>grotesquely promiscuous. Yes, the penis is the
democratic tabernacle of Life. Under its little
Moorish roof, the senses of the race kneel in
common prayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Observe it, Mallare. It is the rendezvous
of expiring illusions, the gathering place
of the anonymities which utilize man, beasts
and plants. See how this curious dwarf staggers
like a bewildered stranger in its shadow.
He is an outcast. He is useless. He is no longer
necessary. Life which made a pretense of him,
enters its tabernacle and closes the doors on
him. Here is the great secret. Here stands the
grim tyrant before whose delicious wrath man
bows himself into annihilations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, what a marvelous tabernacle! It
moves and Goliath follows. It points and
Goliath runs after it. An infatuated tabernacle
that fancies itself going to Heaven! It is proud.
It struts. Goliath shuffles after it like a forlorn
little nigger in the wake of a circus. It leaps.
And Goliath gallops after it. Aha! he lies on
his back impaled. But she!&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Fifty-nine</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;They were on the couch. She sat beside
him but her eyes still sought me. Noises issued
from Goliath. He rolled on his back, kicking
crooked legs and yelping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I watched her white body spread over
him. Her eyes left me and my rhetoric dwindled
into a sigh. I was alone with a spectacle.
Goliath, masturbating with a phantom&mdash;but
not as Mallare had done. No, not as Mallare
who had lain indifferent beside his Frankenstein.
For Goliath&#8217;s arms were around her, his
legs entwined her. His body, an insanity in
itself, made a mate beneath her more incredible
than she. There was silence. Then she
<span class="nw">screamed!&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mallare closed his eyes. A coldness
<ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'tiptoed'">tip-toed</ins> out of his heart. She was laughing.
Her laughter entered his ears&mdash;a noise that
was like a witch&#8217;s flight of sound. But who was
it laughed? Mallare, Mallare laughed. It was
his voice in the phantom that laughed at him.
It was his hallucination he had loved that now
gave itself to a little monster. And it was his
hate that designed this laugh, a thing that
<a name="png.190" id="png.190"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>pierced the heaven in which he sat. Mallare
closed his eyes, a God shuddering before His
own atheism. Yes, rhetoric now. It is easy to
write. My words embroider themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then, when the laugh struck Mallare!
Ah, there was curious mutiny. They went
away. The little Mallares who worship me
went away, all but one. The dumb one. Yes,
I write of him again. He came to me then and
his tears were more horrible than the scream I
had heard. His weeping came too close. His
weeping grew too loud. His arms embraced
me and he held his face too close to mine. And
my name rose from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was alone with him and my fingers
fought with his throat. This blubberer who
had followed me home in the snow, yes this
insufferable melancholiac who rained his tears
into my Heaven&mdash;Mallare would have killed
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was too sly. He slipped away and
sprawled around the room. He beat his hands
against walls and tore at his hair. I followed
<a name="png.191" id="png.191"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-one</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>watching him and coaxing him to come close
once more. I smiled at him to come near again.
But no, he avoided me. He stood against the
curtains facing me and pointing his finger at
me. His mouth was open but no sound came
from it. There was only the noise of my phantom
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stood pointing and I watched my
name come like a dead shout from his lip. His
throat was alive with my name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mallare!&rsquo; it said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I smiled at him. And I worshipped aloud
so that he might hear. I whispered to him to
come close&mdash;this lugubrious blasphemer who
wears my name in his throat. But his face
grew white. His arms dropped and he leaned
against the curtains. His eyes closed and he
fell. The Indifferent One remained. The smile
of Mallare remained contemplating the prostrate
ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The couch was still alive. But it was
dark. Her outline was already disintegrating.
Goliath&#8217;s fingers stared from her back.</p>

<p><a name="png.192" id="png.192"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-two</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&lsquo;The dark comedy ends,&rsquo; I thought. &lsquo;My
phantom dissolves in a suicidal orgasm. And
the little monster beneath her collapses amid
too sudden memories. Finis! The revenge that
I so cleverly manipulated is accomplished.
And now Mallare disgorges a hallucination
become too nauseous. I have fouled this pretty
one so that my senses might abandon her. And
see, they whimper under me. The dumb one
lies in a corner and even his tears are ended.
And this sad eyed one, weary with intolerable
visions, and this one whose ears are filled with
voices&mdash;all of them whimper under me. But
I must feel no pity for them. Mallare rides
away like a star&hellip;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And she dissolves. Vale Rita! The red
and yellow dress again. Yes &hellip; yes&mdash;the
green and orange shawl again. Put them on.
Bravo Rita! Tragedy bows in a decorative
anti-climax. Little one, Mallare banishes thee
from His heaven where thou becamest too intimate.
Because thou sought to seduce His worshippers.
Vale!&mdash;Mallare disgorges thee. Spit
not at Me, little one, for I am only a smile. Spit
<a name="png.193" id="png.193"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>at this dumb one, this blubberer, who has forgotten
himself in a new sleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Goliath weeps. She is gone and his
madness regrets her vanishing. He sits by day
and watches out of the window. At night I
have found him staring at the couch where he
lay with my shadow. He kneels beside it
with his grotesque arms flung out, embracing
memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His madness flatters me. Yet it is a thing
to be studied. His eyes are insane. They roll
continually in their sockets. He beats himself,
knocking his fists against his head. And I have
discovered him on the floor doubled up, his
head buried in his arms. He does not hear me
but remains, while I move around, immobile
as an idol. Yes, little Goliath is mad. But
he cannot recover the illusion whose memory
haunts his dark soul. He suffers. He beats his
head and his tears are futile. For she was mine.
Mallare created her. Mallare destroyed her.
There is a temptation at times to return her&mdash;not
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-four</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to Mallare but to this poor dwarf who
expires under his grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tempted by his madness. Goliath
has found no God in his black heaven. I would
be his God and create for him as I may for
Myself. But I am wary of such altruism. He
is still My servant and looks after Me. But
My smile watches him with caution. His eyes
roll too much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I rid myself of her, there has been
no mutiny. I sit and contemplate problems
that have grown too simple for me. And when
I am bored with studying Goliath&#8217;s madness, I
divert myself with my friend, the lodge brother.
A baffling imbecile who withholds himself
slyly. I have not yet come to an understanding
with him. There are too few facts to go on.
He is silent. He weeps. My name sleeps forever
on his lips. And once he babbled to me of
blood on my hands. These are the only realities
that form a key to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His presence remains a discomfort. We
sit and stare at each other. And I talk quietly
to him.</p>

<p><a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-five</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are an inconsistent ass,&rsquo; I say. &lsquo;You
were first an obvious pathologic symptom&mdash;an
illusory conscience born to adorn the grief of
my senses that fancied they had murdered Rita,
the phantom. But then when you found her
alive, what did you do? Did you vanish as, in
all logic, you should? For Rita was not murdered
and therefore where the necessity of a
conscience to celebrate her crime?</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you remained and grew more dolorous.
Then you are something else. I suspect
you of being the adroit ambassador the madmen
have sent into my heaven to plead their
cause. Yet why do you not plead? As an
ambassador you are a tongue-tied, sniveling
idiot. Therefore again, you escape logic. And
without logic my madness becomes slyly incomprehensible
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We watch each other like two careful
wrestlers, eh? But what hold do you want?
Tell me and I will let you try your strength.
No&mdash;tears, nothing else. You weep, weep until
the sight of you is an impossible ennui.</p>

<p><a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-six</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, perhaps you are a memory of Mallare.
Something forgotten. Logic approaches
you as I think. Something forgotten. And you
are overcome at my infidelity. Like Goliath
you mourn a vanished one. But there is this
difference. Whereas Goliath is real and the
object of his mourning is a phantom&mdash;you and
not I are the phantom. Yes, a phantom mourns
me. But speak then. I have no objection to
memory. Let me hear what this is all about
and I will admit what you say. I will admit it
all beforehand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But no. You expect something else. You
expect Mallare to fall at your feet and embrace
you. I can see that in your eyes&mdash;a monotonous
expectation that grows ludicrous. Yes, your
tears grow ludicrous. I tolerate you for only
one purpose. You are a problem that diverts
me. For if I desired I could do with you as I
did with Rita. There are ways to make you
too nauseous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I might invent another hate for
myself. My hands might tear you as they tore
<a name="png.197" id="png.197"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-seven</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her. And then, filled with a fury against me,
you too might turn to Goliath. He is still mad,
my dwarf, and susceptible to the phantoms I
send him. Do you want to go to him as she did?
Aha! You wince. Remember then that Mallare
has it in his power to send you to his
dwarf, to make you take her place over his
terrible body. And Mallare will do this if you
annoy him too much. And then, sickened with
you as he was with her, he will disgorge another
shadow. Let us be frank about this. I warn
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus I sit and talk quietly to this weeping
one. And when I stop I watch his lips
move with my name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mallare,&rsquo; they say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is his only answer to my overtures.
But I will win him over. He will come close
to my smile and kneel finally before me. He
will confess who he is and what my name means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I grow tired. Goliath stands by his shrine
and weeps. He waits beside a couch as if it
were another Mallare able to give birth to a
<a name="png.198" id="png.198"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Sixty-eight</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>phantom. Poor dwarf, unlike Mallare he has
not learned that suffering is an illusion, that
couches and Medusas are illusions. Unlike
Mallare there is no smile hanging its star above
him.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&ldquo;Sleep comes. A forgotten world babbles
with shadows outside my windows. It is time
to say goodnight to my friend, the lodge brother.
Turn your tears to the cold moon, my friend.
Mallare goes away. Far away into a house
where he is alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="top2">&ldquo;Talk to me, Mallare.
Tell me. Where am I? He
grows larger, this dumb one.
He moves away, growing
larger. He defies distance.
He grows too large to see.
But his tears remain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whisper to me, Mallare. He vanishes
and I must sneak after him. Call me back.
He is strange. His darkness lures me out of
my heaven. A little whisper will save me. You
will say to me, &lsquo;Here is God.&rsquo; I will come back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My words tire of him. He will not listen.
His tears! dear God, are You so human that
<a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Seventy</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they silence You? He has come into my loneliness.
And there is no use debating with him any
longer. Since he followed me home in the snow
his weeping has never wavered. I must talk
not to him but to Mallare. I must debate with
Mallare. But where is he, this Supreme One?
Mallare, where art thou?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my madness becomes an increasing
novelty. I remain. But I grow smaller. I am
too small. Where is my smile? It hides from
me. But his tears fall. This dumb one knows
how to weep. Alas, I drown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to my side. I will whisper. I am
in love. Yes, do not be astonished. I am in
love with her. You recall her? She was like a
curtain fluttering before the door of enchantments.
Her breasts were like little blind faces
raised in prayer. Yes, Rita, my radiant one.
The phantom I constructed. The Phoenix that
arose in my soul. And that I slew again. I am
in love. But my magic no longer works. She
does not return.</p>

<p><a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Seventy-one</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&ldquo;I will whisper. I kneel with Goliath
beside the couch. Ah, Mallare, Mallare&mdash;I
am mad with love. I weep and beat my head.
And this other one calls me away. His shape
grows larger and his darkness lifts me toward
it. He pulls me from the couch. Talk to me,
Mallare. I am mad, but talk to me and I will
understand. Dear, shining Mallare &hellip; Tell
me &lsquo;no&rsquo; and I will break my love. I will put
my fist through the window out of which I
watch for her. And it will be finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I weep. My eyes have caught his
trick. I weep for her. Do you understand this?
My beautiful one whom I disgorged. Yes,
Rita. I die with love of her. I kneel by the
bed that knew her. Whisper back to me, Mallare,
that I am mad. And I will laugh. But
without you I grow too small to laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is pain in the shadows. I ask,
where am I? Go way, then, Mallare. Leave
me. I persist without Mallare. I remain. Let
me dissolve into this. Let me sprawl before
the door of enchantments. It is illusion. Let
<a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Seventy-two</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it be. She will come out. Rita, my vanished
one, come back to me. It is I who ask. Not the
Cold One, not the Indifferent One, not Mallare.
But I &hellip; I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will hold you in my arms. I will feed
your mist with kisses. My body will warm you.
I will be kind. I am not Mallare. He is gone.
He hides. He will not come back. I will kneel
before the door that sings with you. I am mad
with love. See, Rita, I am like Goliath. My
eyes roll. I am mad and you may come to me
without fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Windows break in me again. I remember
this from long ago. Hey, you blubbering
one! Do you want me! Hey, you brother sniveler,
come back! I laugh. Do you understand
this? A laughter without definitions. Ah, forgive
me. You sat and wept and I scolded.
Come back and sit again. I will fall at your
feet. Your eyes asked that. But now&mdash;where
are your feet? There is no shape. How am I
to know where? Come back. Here, sit in this
chair beside me. God! In silence, I utter my
<a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">One Hundred Seventy-three</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>name. But it is a name that has flown away,
flown away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, you, bring me my name. The little
name, the one that made a pantomime on your
lips. The one that stared at me with letters.
Bring me my name, I will understand its
meaning. My other name has flown away.
Listen. Let me whisper. Bring it to me and I
will place it like a gate before the door of
enchantments. I will kneel to it. Windows
break in my head. Mallare &hellip; are you
Mallare? No, you are this. You are a babble
of words that stands on its nose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laugh at me, Mallare. Let me hear your
laugh far away. Or I go. Listen, Mallare. I
turn my back on this darkness. I do not kneel
at empty couches. No. I wait for you. You were
my God. You, the One who contemplated.
Yes, my arms are out to You. Come &hellip; a
whisper out of silences. Hey, Mallare. I dissolve.
I become a little phantom. A useless
